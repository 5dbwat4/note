# Week 1 AVL Tree

## True or False

1. Every subtree of an AVL tree is also an AVL tree.  
   **True**. By definition, an AVL tree is a binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property holds for every subtree as well.

2. Consider an AVL tree. Immediately after we insert a node (without restoring the tree balance), the parent of the newly inserted node may become imbalanced.  
   **False**. The *parent* of the newly inserted node must have been $0 \rightarrow 1$ or $1 \,\text{or} -1$ after insertion. It will never become imbalanced. Such a imbalancement can only occur at the grandparent or higher ancestors.

3. In the following tree, node 1 is imbalanced and it is in case LR.

   **False**. It is in case RR.

## Multiple Choice

1. One of the nodes in the following tree is imbalanced. Which case is it in?  
    <img src="https://images.ptausercontent.com/b1f26a4d-444c-419c-9b7f-62731407f2cb.png" width="200"/>  
    A. LL  
    B. LR  
    C. RR  
    D. RL  
    **Answer: D**. The imbalanced node is 7, and it is in case RL.

2. Insert 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7 into an initially empty AVL tree.  Which one of the following statements is FALSE?  
   A. 4 is the root  
   B. 3 and 7 are siblings  
   C. 2 and 6 are siblings  
   D. 9 is the parent of 7  
    **Answer: B**.


## Multiple Choice More than one answer

1. Suppose that immediately after we delete a node from an AVL tree (without restoring the tree balance), some node u becomes imbalanced. Let T be the subtree rooted at u. How will the height of T change after we rebalance u? (Note that the root of T changes after rebalancing.)  
   A. increases by 1  
   B. does not change  
   C. decreases by 1  
   **Answer: B, C**. The height of T either remains the same or decreases by 1 after rebalancing u.

2. Consider an AVL tree of height $5$. Which of the followings are the possible number of nodes in this tree? We assume that the height of a single node is $1$.  
  A. 10  
  B. 20  
  C. 30  
  D. 35  
  **Answer: B, C**
