# Week 1 AVL Tree

## True or False

1. Every subtree of an AVL tree is also an AVL tree.  
   **True**. By definition, an AVL tree is a binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property holds for every subtree as well.

2. Consider an AVL tree. Immediately after we insert a node (without restoring the tree balance), the parent of the newly inserted node may become imbalanced.  
   **False**. The *parent* of the newly inserted node must have been $0 \rightarrow 1$ or $1 \,\text{or} -1$ after insertion. It will never become imbalanced. Such a imbalancement can only occur at the grandparent or higher ancestors.

3. In the following tree, node 1 is imbalanced and it is in case LR.  
   <img src="https://images.ptausercontent.com/f0799a98-d3ca-434a-911d-2ae9e584bf6f.png" width="200"/>
   **False**. It is in case RR.

## Multiple Choice

1. One of the nodes in the following tree is imbalanced. Which case is it in?  
    <img src="https://images.ptausercontent.com/b1f26a4d-444c-419c-9b7f-62731407f2cb.png" width="200"/>  
    A. LL  
    B. LR  
    C. RR  
    D. RL  
    **Answer: D**. The imbalanced node is 7, and it is in case RL.

2. Insert 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7 into an initially empty AVL tree.  Which one of the following statements is FALSE?  
   A. 4 is the root  
   B. 3 and 7 are siblings  
   C. 2 and 6 are siblings  
   D. 9 is the parent of 7  
    **Answer: B**.


## Multiple Choice More than one answer

1. Suppose that immediately after we delete a node from an AVL tree (without restoring the tree balance), some node u becomes imbalanced. Let T be the subtree rooted at u. How will the height of T change after we rebalance u? (Note that the root of T changes after rebalancing.)  
   A. increases by 1  
   B. does not change  
   C. decreases by 1  
   **Answer: B, C**. The height of T either remains the same or decreases by 1 after rebalancing u.

2. Consider an AVL tree of height $5$. Which of the followings are the possible number of nodes in this tree? We assume that the height of a single node is $1$.  
  A. 10  
  B. 20  
  C. 30  
  D. 35  
  **Answer: B, C**


# Week 2 Red-Black Tree

## True or False

1. The number of nodes, including the external nodes (NIL), in a red black tree must be odd.
   **True**. 
2. Consider a node $u$ of a Red-black tree in extended version. Let $h_L$ and $h_R$ be the height of the left and right subtrees of $u$, respectively. (We assume that the height of a single node is $1$.) We have $\dfrac{1}{2} \leq \dfrac{h_L}{h_R} \leq 2$. 
   **True**.

## Multiple Choice More than one answer

1. Let $u$ be an internal node in a red black tree. Suppose that one child of $u$ is an internal node $v$, and the other is an external node (NIL). Which of the following statements are correct?
   A. $u$ must be red.  
   B. $u$ must be black.
   C. $v$ must be red.
   D. Both children of $v$ are NIL.
   **Answer: B, C, D**. Note that: **since $v$ is sure to be red, $u$ must be black**.


# Week 3 

## True Or False



1. Let $T$ be a BST. If we perform a splay operation on the node with the minimum key, then the root of the resulting tree has no left child.


2. Suppose that the insertion operation of some data structure has a worst-case cost of $\Theta(n)$ and an amortized cost of $O(\log n)$. Starting with the empty structure, if we perform $m$ insertion operations consecutively, the total cost may be as large as $\Theta(m^2)$.



3. The height of a splay tree with $n$ nodes can be as large as $\Theta(n)$.

4. Suppose we have a potential function $\Phi $ such that for all $\Phi(D_i) \geq \Phi(D_0)$ for all $i$, but $\Phi(D_0) \neq 0$. Then there exists a potential $\Phi^\prime $ such that $\Phi ^\prime(D_0) =0$,  $\Phi ^\prime(D_i) \geq 0$ for all $i \geq 1$, and the amortized costs using $\Phi^\prime $ are the same as the amortized costs using $\Phi$.

5. Consider an insertion in a B+ tree. We may need to update some keys stored in some internal nodes even if no leaf is split during the insertion.

6. A B+ tree of order 3 is also called a 2-3 tree. Consider a 2-3 tree with 3 internal nodes. Its leaves can have a maximum number of 18 keys in total.

7. In distributed indexing, document-partitioned strategy is to store on each node all the documents that contain the terms in a certain range.


8. When evaluating the performance of data retrieval, it is important to measure the relevancy of the answer set.


9. Precision is more important than recall when evaluating the explosive detection in airport security.   

10. While accessing a term by hashing in an inverted file index, range searches are expensive.
