# ADS Claims

## Red-Black Tree and B Tree
1.  A red-black tree with N internal nodes has height at most $2\log(N + 1)$.

## Inverted File Index
1.  Precision: $\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_p}$
2.  Recall: $\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_n}$

thresholding is NOT top-k retrieval.

## Leftist Heap and Skew Heap
1.  Npl(NULL) = -1.
2.  A leftist tree with $r$ nodes on the right path must have at least $2^r - 1$ nodes.
3.  It is an open problem to determine precisely the expected right path length of both leftist and skew heaps.
4.  The only nodes whose heavy/light status can change are nodes that are initially on the right path.

## Binomial Heap
1.  A priority queue of any size can be uniquely represented by a collection of binomial trees.
2.  **Complexities:**
    | Operation        | Complexity           |
    |------------------|----------------------|
    | find min         | $O(1)$           |
    | merge            | $O(\log N)$      |
    | insert           | $O(1)$ amortized |
    | delete min       | $O(\log N)$      |
3.  A binomial queue of N elements can be built by N successive insertions in $O(N)$ time.

## Backtracking
1.  Tic-tac-toe with α-β pruning: when both techniques are combined, in practice it limits the searching to only $O(\sqrt{N})$ nodes, where $N$ is the size of the full game tree.

## Divide and Conquer
1.  **Master Theorem** for a specific situation:
    $$
    T(N) = aT(N/b) + O(N^k \log^p N)
    $$
    $$
    T(N) =
    \begin{cases} 
    O(N^{\log_b a}), & \text{if } a > b^k \\
    O(N^k \log^{p+1} N), & \text{if } a = b^k \\
    O(N^k \log^p N), & \text{if } a < b^k
    \end{cases}
    $$

## Greedy
1.  A greedy algorithm works only if the local optimum is equal to the global optimum.
2.  (Reiteration of point 1)
3.  Consider any nonempty subproblem $S_k$, and let $a_m$ be an activity in $S_k$ with the earliest finish time. Then $a_m$ is included in some maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities of $S_k$.

## NP
1.  **Decidability:** Could there exist, at least in principle, any definite method or process by which all mathematical questions could be decided?
2.  Not all decidable problems are in NP. For example, consider the problem of determining whether a graph does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.
3.  Complexity class **co-NP** = the set of languages L such that $\overline{L} \in NP$. e.g., Hamiltonian cycle is **not** co-NP.

## Approximation
1.  $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation, if the algorithm is in polynomial time related to $\epsilon$.
2.  **Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS):** $\epsilon$ is not in the exponent of n.
3.  **Bin packing problem approximation ratios:**
    | Algorithm              | Ratio               |
    |------------------------|---------------------|
    | next fit              | 2M-1                |
    | first fit             | 1.7M                |
    | best fit              | 1.7M                |
    | first fit decreasing  | 11M/9 + 6/9         |
4.  **Knapsack Problem:** Using maximum profit or profit density yields an approximation ratio of 2.
5.  **Center selection problem:** 2-approximation.
6.  Unless P = NP, there is no r-approximation for the center-selection problem for any $r < 2$.

## Local Search
1.  The state-flipping algorithm terminates at a stable configuration after at most $W = \sum \|w_e\|$ iterations.
2.  Any local maximum in the state-flipping algorithm to maximize $F$ (sum of good edge's absolute value) is a stable configuration.
3.  It is still an open question whether this is a polynomial time algorithm.
4.  Let $(A, B)$ be a local optimal partition and let $(A*, B*)$ be a global optimal partition. Then $w(A, B) \geq \frac{1}{2} w(A*, B*)$.
5.  If we only choose a node which, when flipped, increases the cut value by at least $\frac{2\epsilon}{\|V\|} w(A, B)$, then the algorithm returns a cut where $(2 + \epsilon) w(A, B) \geq w(A*, B*)$ and terminates in $O(n/\epsilon \log W)$ iterations.

## Randomized Algorithm
1.  **Online hiring problem:** The probability $Pr[S]$ we hire the best qualified candidate for a given k is bounded by:
    $$
    \frac{k}{N} \ln\left(\frac{k}{N}\right) \leq Pr[S] \leq \frac{k}{N} \ln\left(\frac{k-1}{n-1}\right)
    $$
2.  **Central splitter:** A pivot that divides the set so that each side contains at least $n/4$ elements.
3.  **Modified Quicksort:** Always select a central splitter before recursions.
4.  The expected number of iterations needed to find a central splitter is at most 2.
5.  **Type j:** A subproblem $S$ is of type $j$ if $N(\frac{3}{4})^{j+1} \leq \|S\| \leq N(\frac{3}{4})^{j}$.
6.  There are at most $(\frac{4}{3})^{j+1}$ subproblems of type $j$.

## Parallel
1.  **Maximum finding algorithms:**
    | Partition Size | $T(N)$    | $W(N)$            |
    |----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
    | $N^2$       | 1             | $N^2$             |
    | $\sqrt{N}$  | $\log \log N$ | $N \log \log N$ |
    | $\log \log N$ | $\log \log N$ | $N$             |
2.  **(Monte Carlo) Theorem:** The algorithm finds the maximum among n elements. With very high probability it runs in $O(1)$ time and $O(n)$ work. The probability of not finishing within this time and work is $O(1/n^c)$ for some positive constant $c$.
