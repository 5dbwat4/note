# 26-1  What is a Field (场)?


A FIELD is something that can be defined anywhere in space

- It can be a scalar field (标量场, e.g., Temperature field)
- It can be a vector field (矢量场, e.g., Electric field)

- Fields represent physical quantities (物理量的空间分布).

## Example: Gravitation field (引力场) $ \vec{g} $

The procedure for measuring the gravitational field

- use a test body of small mass $ m_{0} $
- release in the gravitational field
- measure F
- gravitational field:
$$ 
\vec{g}=\frac{\vec{F}}{m_0} 
$$

$$ 
\vec{g}(\vec{r})=-G\frac{M}{r^{2}}\hat{r} 
$$

$ m_{0} $ is small, does not disturb the mass distribution.

The Moon can not be as a test mass.

## Note about gravitation fields

- The force between gravitating bodies was thought of as a direct and instantaneous interaction, action at a distance (超距相互作用).This view violates the special theory of relativity 人们曾认为引力体之间的作用力是一种直接的、瞬时的相互作用，即超距作用。这种观点违反了狭义相对论。 *mass<=>mass*

- A more modern interpretation (现代解释): *mass<=>field<=>mass*
