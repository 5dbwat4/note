### 25-1 ELECTROMAGNETISM: A PREVIEW
What do the following have in common?
1. You turn on the light switch in your room. The consumption of fuel at a power plant produces electromagnetic energy by causing a loop of electrically conducting wire to rotate in the vicinity of a magnet. Ultimately some of this energy is transferred to the electrons in the filament of your lightbulb, which can transform the electrical energy into visible light.
2. You enter a command on your computer keyboard. A stream of electrons is formed to transmit your instructions. There are many thousands of possible pathways for the electrons through the computer circuitry, but most are blocked by electronic gates. Electrons can move only through the gates that have been opened by your command so that the stream of electrons reaches its destination and your command is executed.
3. You push the channel select button on the remote control of your TV set. Electromagnetic waves travel from the remote control unit to a receptor on the set, which then tunes the set to accept another electromagnetic wave that originates from a satellite orbiting high above the Earth. The waves from the satellite provide instructions for your set to use electric and magnetic forces to focus and direct a beam of electrons that strikes the surface of the picture tube and produces a visible image.

The common factor in these diverse phenomena is that they all depend on forces that we describe as electric or magnetic to control and direct the flow of energy or particles. These forces form the basis of our study of electromagnetism. We will find in our study that all electromagnetic effects can be explained by a set of four basic equations, called Maxwell's equations. These equations represent individual laws of electromagnetism, just as we have previously discussed equations that represent Newton’s laws of mechanics or the laws of thermodynamics.

Our study will first consider electric phenomena and then magnetic phenomena. Later we will show that the two cannot be separated; certain electric phenomena produce magnetic effects, and certain magnetic phenomena produce electric effects. This leads us to unify electric and magnetic phenomena under the common name of electromagnetism. The development of the laws of electromagnetism and their unification was a great triumph of 19th-century physics. Their application has led directly to a great range of devices of practical use, such as motors, radios and televisions, radar, microwave ovens, and cellular phones.

The development of electromagnetic theory continued in the 20th century with three very significant advancements. In 1905, Albert Einstein showed that, to a moving observer, electric effects could appear as magnetic effects, and thus observers in relative motion could disagree in assigning their measurements to electric or magnetic causes. This conclusion formed the basis of the special theory of relativity, which ultimately was to revolutionize our concepts of space and time. The second development was the introduction of a quantum theory of electromagnetism, called quantum electrodynamics, which reached its fruition around 1949 and enabled properties of the atom to be calculated with incredible precision, currently about 11 significant figures. The third development of the 20th century was the unification of electromagnetism with another force, called the “weak” force, which is responsible for certain radioactive decay processes and other interactions between particles. Just as electric and magnetic effects were unified into the electromagnetic interaction, so electromagnetic and weak effects were shown in the 1960s to be unified under the electroweak interaction. For our study of electric and magnetic forces, however, the electroweak interaction does not yield anything new, and it is more convenient to consider the separate electromagnetic interaction.

### 25-1 电磁学概述
以下现象有什么共同之处？
1. 你打开房间里的电灯开关。发电厂消耗燃料，通过使一圈导电导线在磁体附近旋转产生电磁能。最终，这些能量的一部分传递到灯泡灯丝中的电子，电子将电能转化为可见光。
2. 你在电脑键盘上输入指令。一束电子流形成并传输你的指令。电子在电脑电路中有成千上万条可能的路径，但大多数路径被电子门阻断。只有你指令打开的电子门，电子才能通过，使电子流到达目的地并执行指令。
3. 你按下电视遥控器上的频道选择按钮。电磁波从遥控器传输到电视上的接收器，电视随后调谐，接收来自高空轨道卫星的另一束电磁波。卫星发出的电磁波为电视提供指令，使其利用电场力和磁场力聚焦并引导电子束，电子束撞击显像管表面并产生可见图像。

这些不同现象的共同之处在于，它们都依赖于我们称之为电场力或磁场力的作用力，来控制和引导能量或粒子的流动。这些力是我们研究电磁学的基础。我们将发现，所有电磁现象都可以用一组被称为麦克斯韦方程组的基本方程来解释。这些方程分别代表电磁学的各个定律，就像我们之前讨论的牛顿力学定律或热力学定律对应的方程一样。

我们的研究将首先探讨电现象，然后是磁现象。之后我们会证明，电现象和磁现象密不可分：某些电现象会产生磁效应，某些磁现象也会产生电效应。这促使我们将电现象和磁现象统一起来，统称为电磁学。电磁学定律的发展及其统一是19世纪物理学的重大成就。它们的应用直接催生了大量实用设备，如电动机、收音机、电视机、雷达、微波炉和手机等。

20世纪，电磁理论的发展取得了三项极具意义的突破。1905年，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦指出，对于运动的观察者来说，电效应可能表现为磁效应，因此相对运动的观察者在将测量结果归因于电原因或磁原因时可能会有不同意见。这一结论构成了狭义相对论的基础，最终彻底改变了我们对空间和时间的认知。第二项突破是电磁学量子理论的提出，即量子电动力学，该理论在1949年左右趋于完善，能够以极高的精度（目前约11位有效数字）计算原子的性质。20世纪的第三项突破是电磁力与另一种力——弱力的统一，弱力负责某些放射性衰变过程和粒子间的其他相互作用。正如电效应和磁效应被统一为电磁相互作用一样，20世纪60年代，电磁相互作用和弱相互作用被证明可统一为电弱相互作用。然而，对于我们研究电场力和磁场力而言，电弱相互作用并未带来新的内容，因此将电磁相互作用单独考虑更为方便。

### 25-2 ELECTRIC CHARGE
After you pass a plastic comb through your hair a few times, you will find that the comb can exert a force on individual strands of your hair. You may also observe that, once the strands of hair are attracted to the comb and come into contact with it, they may no longer be attracted to it.

It seems reasonable to conclude that the attraction between the comb and the hair is a result of some physical entity being transferred from one to the other when they rub together, with the same physical entity being transferred back again to neutralize the attraction when they come into contact. This physical entity is called electric charge, and today we understand this transfer on the basis of electrons that can be removed from the atoms of one object and attached to the atoms of the other object.

The transfer of electric charge by means of friction is a commonly observed phenomenon. It was known to the ancient Greeks, who observed that pieces of amber rubbed with fur could attract bits of straw. When you walk across a carpet and are shocked by touching a metal door knob, or when a lightning flash stretches between a cloud and the ground, you are observing the effects of this transfer of charge.

When we “charge” an object (that is, when we transfer charge to it), we find that it can exert a force on another charged object. Early observations that this force can be either attractive or repulsive led to the conclusion that there are two kinds of electrical charge, which are called positive and negative.*

Although effects resulting from the transfer of charge can be powerful, it is remarkable that they originate from the transfer of only a tiny fraction of the electric charge that is contained in objects. Ordinary matter is made of electrically neutral atoms or molecules that contain equal amounts of positive charge (the nucleus) and negative charge (the electrons). When two objects rub together, relatively few electrons from the atoms of one object are transferred to the other; most of the electrons remain undisturbed. It is this slight upset of the balance between the enormous but equal amounts of positive and negative charge in an object that is responsible for most commonly observed electrical effects.

When we rub a plastic rod with fur, electrons are transferred to the rod; because it has an excess of electrons (which carry a negative charge), the rod becomes negatively charged. The fur now has a deficiency of electrons and so it is positively charged. We can see the attraction of the rod for individual strands of the fur, which results from the charge on each. In a similar way, we can rub a glass rod with silk and observe that both become charged and can attract one another. In each case, we have transferred a relatively small number of electrons and upset the electrical neutrality of these objects.

Let us charge a glass rod by rubbing one end of it with silk and then suspend it from a thread, as in Fig. 25-2. If we place a similarly charged glass rod nearby, we find that the two rods repel one another, as in Fig. 25-2a. However, if we place a charged plastic rod (charged by rubbing with fur) nearby, the two rods attract one another, as in Fig. 25-2b.

We account for the existence of these two kinds of forces in terms of two kinds of charge. When plastic is rubbed with fur, electrons are transferred to the plastic and it becomes negatively charged. When glass is rubbed with silk, electrons are transferred to the silk, leaving the glass with a deficiency of electrons and therefore a net positive charge. The forces observed in Fig. 25-2 can be summarized by the following rule:

Charges of the same sign repel one another, and charges of the opposite sign attract one another.

In Section 25-4, we put this rule into quantitative form, as Coulomb's law of force. We consider only charges that are either at rest with respect to each other or moving very slowly, a restriction that defines the subject of electrostatics.

Electrical forces between charged bodies have many industrial applications, including electrostatic paint spraying and powder coating, fly-ash precipitation, nonimpact ink-jet printing, and photocopying. Figure 25-3 for example, shows a tiny carrier bead in a photocopying machine, covered with particles of black powder called toner, that stick to the carrier bead by electrostatic forces. These negatively charged toner particles are eventually attracted from their carrier beads to a positively charged latent image of the document to be copied, which is formed on a rotating drum. A charged sheet of paper then attracts the toner particles from the drum to itself, after which they are heat-fused in place to make the final copy.

The net electric charge of an object is usually represented by the symbol $q$. The charge is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative, depending on whether the object has a net positive or negative charge. Electric charge is measured in units of coulombs (C). The coulomb is a very large unit of charge; it takes about $6 × 10^{18}$ electrons to make one coulomb of charge.

The coulomb cannot be derived from previously defined units. Because electric charge is a new quantity, we are free to define its basic unit in any convenient way. One possible way would be in terms of the force exerted between two standard charges at a given separation, such as the quantity of charge that exerts a force of one newton on a similar charge a distance of one meter away. However, the force between static charges is difficult to measure, and so in practice it is more useful to define the coulomb in terms of the magnetic force between current-carrying wires (which is discussed in Chapter 33). This force can be measured more precisely than the electric force between static charges. It is therefore more convenient to define an SI base unit in terms of current (rate of flow of electric charge per unit time). The coulomb as a unit for electric charge is then a derived unit, obtained from the fundamental units of current and time (see Appendix A).

#### Electric Charge Is Quantized
When we transfer electric charge from one object to another, the transfer cannot be done in arbitrarily small units. That is, the flow of charge as a current is not a continuous flow, but is made up of discrete elements.* Experiments show that the electric charge always exists only in quantities that are integer multiples of a certain elementary quantity of charge $e$. That is, 
$$ q = n e \quad n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, ... \quad (25-1) $$
where (to four significant figures) 
$$ e = 1.602 × 10^{-19} C $$

The elementary charge $e$ is one of the fundamental constants of nature whose experimental value has been determined to an uncertainty of about 4 parts in $10^8$.

The electron and the proton are examples of commonly occurring particles that each carry one fundamental unit of charge. The electron has a charge of $-e$ and the proton has a charge of $+e$. Some particles, such as the neutron, carry no net electric charge. Other elementary particles are known that carry charges that are small multiples of $e$, usually $\pm 1, \pm 2$, or $\pm 3$. Each particle has a corresponding antiparticle, which has the same mass but the opposite electric charge; the antielectron, which is known as the positron, has a charge of $+e$. Antiparticles do not commonly exist in nature, but can be created in decays and reactions of nuclei and elementary particles.

Equation 25-1 tells us that it is possible to have a net charge on an object of $+10e$ or $-6e$ but never $3.57e$. When the values of a property are restricted to discrete multiples of a basic quantity, we say that the property is quantized.

Because the elementary charge is small, under ordinary circumstances we are not aware of the discrete nature of the flow of charge. For example, in a wire of an electronic circuit in which small currents of one milliampere are typical, $6 × 10^{15}$ electrons pass through any cross section of the wire every second!

Ordinary atoms are electrically neutral, which means that they contain equal quantities of positive and negative charge. The nucleus of the atom contains $Z$ protons (where $Z$ is called the atomic number of the atom) and thus a charge of $+Ze$. In a neutral atom, $Z$ negatively charged electrons circulate about the nucleus. It is often possible to remove one or more electrons from an atom, creating an ion that has an excess positive charge of $+e, +2e, ...$. For example, if we could remove all of the electrons from an atom of uranium $(Z=92)$, we would create a particle with a charge of $+92e$. Under certain circumstances, we can even attach an extra electron to a neutral atom, creating a negatively charged ion.

Although we believe electrons to be fundamental particles with no substructure, protons are not fundamental particles. They are made up of more elementary entities called quarks. The quarks are assigned fractional electric charges of $-\frac{1}{3}e$ and $+\frac{2}{3}e$. The proton is composed of three quarks, two with charges of $+\frac{2}{3}e$ and one with charge of $-\frac{1}{3}e$, which add up to a net charge of $+e$. Experimental evidence for the existence of quarks inside the proton is very strong (for example, high-energy electrons can be made to scatter from the fractionally charged quarks inside the proton), but, no matter how violently the protons are made to collide, no free quark has been released. As a result, no free particle with a fractional charge has ever been observed. This fact can be understood if the attractive force that one quark exerts on another increases with their separation. This is in contrast to the electromagnetic and gravitational forces, both of which decrease as the distance between a pair of interacting bodies increases.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-1
A penny, being electrically neutral, contains equal amounts of positive and negative charge. What is the magnitude of these equal charges?

**Solution** The charge $q$ is given by $NZe$, in which $N$ is the number of atoms in a penny and $Ze$ is the magnitude of the positive and the negative charges carried by each atom.

The number $N$ of atoms in a penny, assumed for simplicity to be made of copper, is $N_A m / M$ in which $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant. The mass $m$ of the coin is 3.11 g, and the mass $M$ of 1 mol of copper (called its molar mass) is 63.5 g. We find 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
N &= \frac{N_A m}{M} \\ 
&= \frac{(6.02 × 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol})(3.11 \text{ g})}{63.5 \text{ g/mol}} \\ 
&= 2.95 × 10^{22} \text{ atoms}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Every neutral atom has a negative charge of magnitude $Ze$ associated with its electrons and a positive charge of the same magnitude associated with its nucleus. Here $e$ is the elementary charge, $1.60 × 10^{-19} C$, and $Z$ is the atomic number of the element in question. For copper, $Z$ is 29. The magnitude of the total negative or positive charge in a penny is then 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
q &= NZe \\ 
&= (2.95 × 10^{22})(29)(1.60 × 10^{-19} C) \\ 
&= 1.37 × 10^5 C.
\end{aligned}
$$

This is an enormous charge. By comparison, the charge that you might get by rubbing a plastic rod is perhaps $10^{-9} C$, smaller by a factor of about $10^{14}$. For another comparison, it would take 1-2 days for a charge of $1.37 × 10^5 C$ to flow through the filament of a typical lightbulb. There is a lot of electric charge in ordinary matter.

\* In Franklin's day, electric charge was thought to be a substance and to flow as a continuous fluid. Today we know that fluids are made up of individual atoms and molecules—matter is discrete. Similarly, the “electric fluid” is not continuous but discrete.

### 25-2 电荷
用塑料梳子梳几次头发后，你会发现梳子能对每根头发施加作用力。你可能还会观察到：当头发被梳子吸引并与梳子接触后，头发可能就不再被梳子吸引了。

我们有理由得出这样的结论：梳子与头发之间的吸引力，是两者摩擦时某种物理实体从一方转移到另一方的结果；而当它们接触时，这种物理实体会再次转移，从而抵消吸引力。这种物理实体被称为电荷。如今我们知道，这种转移的本质是电子从一个物体的原子中脱离，附着到另一个物体的原子上。

通过摩擦转移电荷是一种常见现象。古希腊人就已发现：用毛皮摩擦过的琥珀能吸引稻草屑。当你走过地毯后触摸金属门把手时感到电击，或是看到云层与地面之间闪过闪电，这些都是电荷转移产生的现象。

当我们给一个物体“充电”（即向其转移电荷）时，会发现它能对另一个带电物体施加作用力。早期观察发现，这种作用力既可能是吸引力，也可能是排斥力，这使我们得出结论：存在两种电荷，分别称为正电荷和负电荷*。

尽管电荷转移产生的效应可能十分显著，但值得注意的是，这些效应仅源于物体中所含电荷的极小一部分转移。普通物质由电中性的原子或分子构成，这些原子或分子中包含等量的正电荷（原子核）和负电荷（电子）。当两个物体相互摩擦时，只有极少量电子从一个物体的原子转移到另一个物体，大多数电子仍保持原状。正是物体中大量且等量的正、负电荷之间的这种微小失衡，导致了我们常见的大多数电现象。

用毛皮摩擦塑料棒时，电子会转移到塑料棒上。由于塑料棒中电子过剩（电子带负电），它会带负电；而毛皮因失去电子，会带正电。我们能看到塑料棒对每根毛皮纤维的吸引力，这正是两者带电的结果。类似地，用丝绸摩擦玻璃棒，会发现两者都带电且相互吸引。在这两种情况下，我们都只转移了相对少量的电子，打破了物体的电中性。

如图25-2所示，我们用丝绸摩擦玻璃棒的一端使其带电，然后用细线将其悬挂起来。若将另一根同样带电的玻璃棒靠近它，会发现两根玻璃棒相互排斥（图25-2a）；但如果将一根带电的塑料棒（用毛皮摩擦带电）靠近它，两根棒会相互吸引（图25-2b）。

我们用两种电荷的存在来解释这两种作用力：用毛皮摩擦塑料棒时，电子转移到塑料棒上，使塑料棒带负电；用丝绸摩擦玻璃棒时，电子转移到丝绸上，玻璃棒因失去电子而带净正电。图25-2中观察到的作用力可总结为以下规律：

**同种电荷相互排斥，异种电荷相互吸引。**

在25-4节中，我们将把这一规律转化为定量形式，即库仑力定律。我们只考虑相对静止或运动极慢的电荷，这一限制条件定义了静电学的研究范畴。

带电体之间的电场力在工业中有许多应用，包括静电喷漆与粉末涂层、飞灰收集、非撞击式喷墨打印和复印等。例如，图25-3展示了复印机中的一个微小载体珠，其表面附着黑色粉末（称为墨粉），墨粉通过静电力吸附在载体珠上。这些带负电的墨粉颗粒最终会从载体珠上被吸引到旋转硒鼓上的“潜像”（待复印文档的正电图像）上。随后，带电的纸张会将墨粉颗粒从硒鼓上吸引过来，经加热熔合后形成最终的复印件。

物体的净电荷通常用符号$q$表示。电荷是标量，可正可负，取决于物体带净正电还是净负电。电荷的单位是库仑（C）。库仑是一个非常大的单位：约需$6 × 10^{18}$个电子才能累积出1库仑的电荷。

库仑无法由先前定义的单位推导得出。由于电荷是一个新的物理量，我们可以按任意便捷的方式定义其基本单位。一种可能的方式是：基于两个标准电荷在特定距离下的作用力来定义，例如，将“在1米距离上对同种电荷施加1牛作用力的电荷量”定义为1库仑。但静电荷之间的作用力难以精确测量，因此在实际中，更实用的方法是根据载流导线之间的磁场力（将在第33章讨论）来定义库仑。这种磁场力比静电荷之间的电场力更易精确测量。因此，国际单位制（SI）中先定义电流（单位时间内电荷的流动速率）为基本单位，而库仑作为电荷的单位，是由电流和时间的基本单位推导而来的导出单位（见附录A）。

#### 电荷的量子化
当我们将电荷从一个物体转移到另一个物体时，转移的电荷量无法无限小。也就是说，电荷的流动（即电流）并非连续的，而是由离散的单元构成*。实验表明，电荷的存在形式始终是某个基本电荷量$e$的整数倍，即：
$$ q = n e \quad n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, ... \quad (25-1) $$
其中（保留四位有效数字）：
$$ e = 1.602 × 10^{-19} C $$

基本电荷量$e$是自然界的基本常数之一，其实验测量值的不确定度约为$4 × 10^{-8}$（即4亿分之一）。

电子和质子是常见的携带基本电荷量的粒子：电子带$-e$的电荷，质子带$+e$的电荷。有些粒子（如中子）不带净电荷。已知其他一些基本粒子携带的电荷量是$e$的小整数倍（通常为$\pm 1、\pm 2$或$\pm 3$）。每种粒子都有对应的反粒子，反粒子与原粒子质量相同但电荷相反——例如，电子的反粒子（正电子）带$+e$的电荷。反粒子在自然界中不常见，但可在原子核衰变和基本粒子反应中产生。

由式（25-1）可知，物体的净电荷可以是$+10e$或$-6e$，但绝不可能是$3.57e$。当某种物理量的取值只能是某个基本量的离散倍数时，我们称该物理量是“量子化”的。

由于基本电荷量$e$非常小，在通常情况下，我们无法察觉电荷流动的离散性。例如，在电子电路的导线中，典型的小电流（1毫安）意味着每秒有约$6 × 10^{15}$个电子通过导线的任意横截面！

普通原子是电中性的，这意味着原子中正、负电荷的总量相等。原子核包含$Z$个质子（$Z$称为原子序数），因此带$+Ze$的电荷；在中性原子中，有$Z$个带负电的电子围绕原子核运动。我们通常可以从原子中移除一个或多个电子，形成带净正电（$+e、+2e$等）的离子。例如，若将铀原子（$Z=92$）的所有电子都移除，会得到一个带$+92e$电荷的粒子。在某些情况下，我们还能给中性原子添加一个额外的电子，形成带负电的离子。

尽管我们认为电子是无内部结构的基本粒子，但质子并非基本粒子——它由更基本的“夸克”构成。夸克的电荷量被定义为$-\frac{1}{3}e$和$+\frac{2}{3}e$：质子由三个夸克组成，其中两个夸克带$+\frac{2}{3}e$的电荷，一个夸克带$-\frac{1}{3}e$的电荷，总电荷量为$+e$。有充分的实验证据表明质子内部存在夸克（例如，高能电子可与质子内部带分数电荷的夸克发生散射），但无论如何剧烈地撞击质子，都无法释放出自由夸克。因此，从未观察到带分数电荷的自由粒子。这一现象可解释为：夸克之间的吸引力随间距增大而增强，这与电场力和万有引力（两者均随间距增大而减弱）截然不同。

#### 例题25-1
一枚便士（硬币）呈电中性，其内部正、负电荷的总量相等。该等量电荷的大小是多少？

**解答** 电荷$q$的表达式为$q = NZe$，其中$N$是便士中的原子总数，$Ze$是单个原子所带正、负电荷的大小。

为简化计算，假设便士由铜制成。铜原子的总数$N$可由阿伏伽德罗常数$N_A$、便士质量$m$和铜的摩尔质量$M$计算得出，公式为$N = \frac{N_A m}{M}$。已知便士质量$m = 3.11 \, \text{g}$，铜的摩尔质量$M = 63.5 \, \text{g/mol}$，代入得：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
N &= \frac{N_A m}{M} \\ 
&= \frac{(6.02 × 10^{23} \, \text{原子/摩尔})(3.11 \, \text{克})}{63.5 \, \text{克/摩尔}} \\ 
&= 2.95 × 10^{22} \, \text{个原子}.
\end{aligned}
$$

每个中性原子中，电子所带负电荷的大小与原子核所带正电荷的大小均为$Ze$（$e = 1.60 × 10^{-19} \, \text{C}$为基本电荷量，$Z$为元素的原子序数）。对于铜，$Z = 29$。因此，便士中总负电荷或总正电荷的大小为：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
q &= NZe \\ 
&= (2.95 × 10^{22})(29)(1.60 × 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \\ 
&= 1.37 × 10^5 \, \text{C}.
\end{aligned}
$$

这是一个极大的电荷量。相比之下，用塑料棒摩擦产生的电荷约为$10^{-9} \, \text{C}$，仅为其$10^{14}$分之一（即100万亿分之一）。另一个对比：让$1.37 × 10^5 \, \text{C}$的电荷流过普通灯泡的灯丝，大约需要1-2天时间。这表明，普通物质中蕴含着大量电荷。

\* 在富兰克林时代，人们认为电荷是一种物质，能像连续流体一样流动。如今我们知道，流体由单个原子和分子构成（物质是离散的）；类似地，“电荷流”也不是连续的，而是离散的。



### 25-3 CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Materials are commonly classified based on the ability of electrons to flow through them. In some materials, such as metals, electrons can move relatively freely. We call these materials conductors. Electrons deposited at one location in the material can easily move throughout the material. Other examples of conductors include tap water and the human body.

In other materials, electrons can hardly flow at all. Electrons deposited at one location will remain at that location. We call these materials insulators. Examples of insulators include glass, plastics, and many crystalline materials such as NaCl.

If you try to charge a copper rod by holding it in your hand and rubbing it with fur, you will not be successful. Electrons may be transferred from the rod to the fur as a result of friction, but additional electrons will easily flow from your body through your hand into the rod to replace those that were removed. As a result, no net charge builds up on the rod due to rubbing. We can consider the Earth to possess an infinite supply of electrons, some of which can flow into your body to replace those that have been lost to the rod. When we have a pathway through which electrons can flow between an object and the Earth, the object is said to be electrically grounded.

If instead we attach a plastic handle to the copper rod, we find that we can build up a charge by rubbing it. The insulating handle blocks the flow of electrons between the rod and your body.

Isolated atoms of a conducting material such as copper generally contain loosely bound electrons that can easily be detached, leaving a positively charged ion. When copper atoms come together to form solid copper, these loosely bound electrons do not remain attached to individual atoms but become free to wander through the material. These free electrons are called conduction electrons; in copper, a typical conductor, there are about $ 10^{23} $ conduction electrons per $ cm^3 $. The positively charged ions are not free to move and remain fixed within the solid lattice structure of the copper.

The experiment of Fig. 25-4 demonstrates the mobility of charge in a conductor. An uncharged copper rod is suspended by an insulating thread. When a positively charged glass rod is brought near one end of the copper, the mobile conduction electrons in the copper are attracted by the positive charges on the glass. The flow of electrons to the near end of the copper leaves the far end with a deficiency of electrons and a net positive charge. The negatively charged end of the copper rod and the positively charged glass exert attractive forces on one another. Note that this situation is very different from that of Fig. 25-2; in Fig. 25-4, the glass attracts a copper rod that carries no net charge. (As we will discuss in the next section, the electrical force depends inversely on the separation between the charges; therefore the attractive force between the glass and the negative end of the copper rod is much stronger than the repulsive force between the glass and the positive end of the copper rod.)

If instead of a positively charged glass rod in Fig. 25-4 we used a negatively charged plastic rod, the effect would be the same: an attractive force between the plastic and the copper. In this case the negatively charged plastic would repel the conduction electrons of the copper, leaving the near end of the copper with a positive charge. There would be an attractive force between the negatively charged plastic and the positively charged end of the copper rod.

It is also possible to have an attractive force between a charged body and an uncharged insulator. Figure 25-5a shows a charged comb attracting uncharged bits of paper. The explanation for this attraction is different from that of the attraction between the glass rod and the copper rod. In this case, the paper is an insulator, and it is not possible for electrons to collect on one end of the paper (as was the case for the conductor in Fig. 25-4). Instead, electrons in individual molecules in the bits of paper are repelled by the negatively charged comb, and so the electrons are preferentially located on the side of each molecule that is away from the comb. In each molecule, the positive end (the end with a lack of electrons) is closest to the comb and feels a greater force of attraction to the comb. This is responsible for the net attractive force between the comb and the paper (Fig. 25-5b). The same attractive force would occur if the comb were positively charged.

The separation of positive and negative charge in an isolated object under the influence of a nearby charged object is known as polarization. Polarization can occur at the macroscopic level, such as in the copper rod of Fig. 25-4, or at the molecular level, as in Fig. 25-5.

#### Charging by Contact and by Induction
Suppose now we touch a positively charged glass rod to an uncharged copper rod (as in Fig. 25-6). Electrons will flow from the copper to neutralize the positive charges on the glass. However, because electrons do not flow through the glass, they can neutralize only those positive charges at the point of contact with the copper. To remove additional electrons from the copper, we can “wipe” the glass rod along the copper rod, thereby transferring electrons to fresh, unneutralized areas of the glass that come into contact with the copper (Fig. 25-6a). If we then remove the glass rod, the copper remains with a deficiency of electrons and therefore a net positive charge. Electrons will flow through the copper so that the positive charges (the ion cores) are evenly distributed along the surface of the copper. This direct transfer of charge from one object to another is called charging by contact. Even though negative electrons were actually transferred, it is often convenient to regard the experiment shown in Fig. 25-6 as if positive charges were transferred from the glass rod to the copper.

Let us return to the situation of Fig. 25-4. If we attach a wire between the positive end of the copper and ground (as in Fig. 25-7a), electrons will flow from ground to neutralize the positive charges in the copper. Leaving the glass rod in place, if we then remove the connection to ground, the copper rod retains a net negative charge. If we then remove the glass rod the negative charges will distribute themselves over the surface of the copper (Fig. 25-7b) to be as far apart from one another as possible. This method of charging an object is called charging by induction. Note that we have been able to use the positively charged glass rod to transfer either positive charge to the copper by contact or negative charge (from ground) by induction.

### 25-3 导体与绝缘体
根据电子在材料中流动的难易程度，材料通常可分为两类。在某些材料（如金属）中，电子能相对自由地移动，这类材料被称为导体。沉积在导体某一位置的电子可轻松在材料内部移动。导体的其他例子还包括自来水和人体。

而在另一些材料中，电子几乎无法流动——沉积在某一位置的电子会一直停留在该位置，这类材料被称为绝缘体。绝缘体的例子包括玻璃、塑料以及许多晶体材料（如氯化钠，NaCl）。

若你用手握住铜棒并试图通过摩擦毛皮给铜棒充电，结果会失败。摩擦确实可能使电子从铜棒转移到毛皮上，但额外的电子会从你的身体经手部轻松流入铜棒，补充被转移走的电子。因此，摩擦无法使铜棒积累净电荷。我们可以认为地球拥有无限多的电子，其中一部分可流入人体，补充人体转移到铜棒的电子。当物体与地球之间存在电子可流动的路径时，我们称该物体“接地”（电接地）。

但若给铜棒装上塑料手柄，我们就能通过摩擦使其带电。这是因为绝缘的塑料手柄阻断了铜棒与人体之间的电子流动。

导体材料（如铜）的孤立原子中，通常含有结合力较弱的电子——这些电子很容易脱离原子，留下带正电的离子。当铜原子结合形成固态铜时，这些结合力较弱的电子不再附着于单个原子，而是能在材料内部自由移动，这类电子被称为传导电子。在铜（典型的导体）中，每立方厘米约含有$ 10^{23} $个传导电子。带正电的离子无法自由移动，会固定在铜的固态晶格结构中。

图25-4的实验可证明导体中电荷的流动性：将一根不带电的铜棒用绝缘细线悬挂，当把带正电的玻璃棒靠近铜棒的一端时，铜棒中的传导电子会被玻璃棒上的正电荷吸引，向铜棒的近端流动。这使得铜棒的远端因失去电子而带净正电，近端带负电；带负电的铜棒近端与带正电的玻璃棒之间会产生吸引力。需注意，这种情况与图25-2截然不同：图25-4中，玻璃棒吸引的是一根不带净电荷的铜棒。（正如我们将在后续章节讨论的，电场力与电荷间距离的平方成反比，因此玻璃棒与铜棒负电端之间的吸引力，远大于其与铜棒正电端之间的排斥力。）

若在图25-4中用带负电的塑料棒替代带正电的玻璃棒，效果会相同——塑料棒与铜棒之间仍会产生吸引力。此时，带负电的塑料棒会排斥铜棒中的传导电子，使铜棒近端因失去电子而带正电，带负电的塑料棒与铜棒正电端之间便会产生吸引力。

带电体与不带电的绝缘体之间也可能产生吸引力。图25-5a显示，带电的梳子能吸引不带电的纸屑。这种吸引力的原理与玻璃棒和铜棒之间的吸引力不同：纸屑是绝缘体，电子无法像在导体（图25-4中的铜棒）中那样聚集在纸屑的一端。相反，纸屑中单个分子的电子会被带负电的梳子排斥，偏向分子远离梳子的一侧；而分子中带正电的一端（电子缺失的一端）距离梳子更近，受到的吸引力更强。这就导致梳子与纸屑之间产生了净吸引力（图25-5b）。若梳子带正电，也会产生同样的吸引力。

在附近带电体的作用下，孤立物体中的正、负电荷发生分离的现象，被称为极化。极化可发生在宏观层面（如图25-4中的铜棒），也可发生在分子层面（如图25-5中的纸屑）。

#### 接触起电与感应起电
如图25-6所示，若将带正电的玻璃棒与不带电的铜棒接触，铜棒中的电子会流向玻璃棒，中和玻璃棒上的正电荷。但由于电子无法在玻璃中流动，铜棒的电子只能中和玻璃棒与铜棒接触点处的正电荷。若要从铜棒中转移更多电子，可将玻璃棒沿铜棒表面“擦拭”——这样，铜棒的电子能转移到玻璃棒上未被中和的新接触区域（图25-6a）。移除玻璃棒后，铜棒因失去电子而带净正电；铜棒内部的电子会进一步流动，使正电荷（离子核）均匀分布在铜棒表面。这种通过物体间直接接触转移电荷的方式，被称为接触起电。尽管实际转移的是带负电的电子，但为方便描述，通常会将图25-6的实验简化为“正电荷从玻璃棒转移到铜棒”。

回到图25-4的场景：若用导线将铜棒的正电端与大地连接（图25-7a），大地中的电子会流入铜棒，中和铜棒的正电荷。保持玻璃棒位置不变，移除接地线后，铜棒会保留净负电荷；再移走玻璃棒，铜棒上的负电荷会在表面重新分布，尽可能彼此远离（图25-7b）。这种给物体充电的方式被称为感应起电。值得注意的是，利用同一根带正电的玻璃棒，我们既可以通过接触给铜棒充正电，也可以通过感应（从大地引入电子）给铜棒充负电。


### 25-4 COULOMB’S LAW
So far in this chapter we have established that there are two kinds of electric charge and that charges exert forces on each other. It is now our goal to understand the nature of this force.

The first successful quantitative experiments to study the force between electric charges were done by Charles Augustin Coulomb (1736-1806), who measured electrical attractions and repulsions and deduced the law that governs them. In principle, Coulomb's apparatus is similar to Fig. 25-2, except that he used small charged spheres indicated by a and b in Fig. 25-8.

If a and b are charged, the electric force on a tends to twist the suspension fiber. Coulomb cancelled out this twisting effect by turning the suspension head through the angle θ needed to keep the two charges at a particular separation. The angle θ is then a relative measure of the electric force acting on charge a. The device of Fig. 25-8 is a torsion balance; a similar arrangement was used later by Cavendish to measure gravitational attractions (Section 14-3).

Experiments by Coulomb and his contemporaries showed that the electrical force exerted by one charged body on another depends directly on the product of the magnitudes of the two charges and inversely on the square of their separation. That is, 
$$F \propto \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$$

Here F is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$, and r is the distance between their centers. The force on each charge due to the other acts along the line connecting the charges. As required by Newton's third law, the force exerted by $q_{1}$ on $q_{2}$ is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by $q_{2}$ on $q_{1}$, even though the magnitudes of the charges may be different.

To turn the above proportionality into an equation, we introduce a constant of proportionality K which we can call the Coulomb constant. We thus obtain, for the force between the charges, 
$$F=K \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$$

Equation 25-2, which is called Coulomb's law, generally holds only for charged objects whose sizes are much smaller than the distance between them. We often say that it holds only for point charges.

Our belief in Coulomb's law does not rest quantitatively on Coulomb's experiments. Such measurements could not, for example, convince us that the exponent of r in Eq. 25-2 is exactly 2 and not, say 2.0001. In Section 27-7 we show that Coulomb’s law can also be deduced from an indirect experiment, which shows that, if the exponent in Eq. 25-2 is not exactly 2, it differs from 2 by at most $1 × 10^{-16}$.

Coulomb's law resembles Newton's inverse square law of gravitation, $F=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$, which was already 100 years old at the time of Coulomb’s experiments. Both are inverse square laws, and the charge q plays the same role in Coulomb's law that the mass m plays in Newton's law of gravitation. One difference between the two laws is that gravitational forces are always attractive, whereas electrostatic forces can be repulsive or attractive, depending on whether the two charges have the same or opposite signs.

In the SI system, the constant K is expressed in the following form: 
$$K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \quad (25-3)$$

Although the choice of this form for the constant K appears to make Coulomb's law needlessly complex, it ultimately results in a simplification of formulas of electromagnetism that are used more often than Coulomb's law.

The constant $\epsilon_{0}$, which is called the electric constant (also known as the permittivity), has a value that is determined by the value of the speed of light, as we discuss in Chapter 39. Its exact value is 
$$\epsilon_{0}=8.85418781762 × 10^{-12} C^{2}/N·m^{2}$$

The Coulomb constant K has the corresponding value (to three significant figures) 
$$K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2}$$

With this choice of the constant K, expressing q in coulombs and r in meters gives the force in newtons.

The significance of Coulomb’s law goes far beyond the description of the forces exerted by charged spheres on each other. This law, when incorporated into the structure of quantum physics, correctly describes (1) the electrical forces that bind the electrons of an atom to its nucleus, (2) the forces that bind atoms together to form molecules, and (3) the forces that bind atoms and molecules together to form solids or liquids. Thus most of the forces of our daily experience that are not gravitational in nature are electrical.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-2
In Sample Problem 25-1 we saw that a copper penny contains both positive and negative charges, each of a magnitude $1.37 × 10^{5} C$. Suppose that these charges could be concentrated into two separate bundles, held 100 m apart. What attractive force would act on each bundle?

**Solution** From Eq. 25-4 we have 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{|q|^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.37 × 10^{5} C)^{2}}{(100 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=1.69 × 10^{16} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

This is about $2 × 10^{12}$ tons of force! Even if the charges were separated by one Earth diameter, the attractive force would still be about 120 tons. In all of this, we have sidestepped the problem of forming each of the separated charges into a “bundle” whose dimensions are small compared to their separation. Such bundles, if they could ever be formed, would be blasted apart by mutual Coulomb repulsion forces.

The lesson of this sample problem is that you cannot disturb the electrical neutrality of ordinary matter very much. If you try to pull out any sizable fraction of the charge contained in a body, a large Coulomb force appears automatically, tending to pull it back.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-3
The average distance r between the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom is $5.3 × 10^{-11} m$. (a) What is the magnitude of the average electrostatic force that acts between these two particles? (b) What is the magnitude of the average gravitational force that acts between these particles?

**Solution (a)** From Eq. 25-4 we have, for the electrostatic force, 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{e}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.60 × 10^{-19} C)^{2}}{(5.3 × 10^{-11} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=8.2 × 10^{-8} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

Although this force may seem small (it is about equal to the weight of a speck of dust), it produces an enormous acceleration of the electron within the atom, about $10^{23} m/s^{2}$.

**(b)** For the gravitational force, we have 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{g}&=G \frac{m_{e}m_{p}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(6.67 × 10^{-11} N·m^{2}/kg^{2})(9.11 × 10^{-31} kg)(1.67 × 10^{-27} kg)}{(5.3 × 10^{-11} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=3.6 × 10^{-47} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that the gravitational force is weaker than the electrostatic force by a factor of about $10^{39}$. Although the gravitational force is weak, it is always attractive. Thus it can act to build up very large masses, as in the formation of stars and galaxies, so that large gravitational forces can develop. The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is repulsive for charges of the same sign, so that it is not possible to accumulate large concentrations of either positive or negative charge. We must always have the two types of charge together, so that they largely compensate for each other. The charges that we are accustomed to in our daily experiences are slight disturbances of this overriding balance.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-4
The nucleus of an iron atom has a radius of about $4 × 10^{-15} m$ and contains 26 protons. What repulsive electrostatic force acts between two protons in such a nucleus if they are separated by a distance of one radius?

**Solution** From Eq. 25-4 we have 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.60 × 10^{-19} C)^{2}}{(4 × 10^{-15} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=14 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

The large repulsive electrostatic force, more than 3 lb and acting on a single proton, must be balanced by the attractive nuclear force that binds the nucleus together. This force, whose range is so short that its effects cannot be felt very far outside the nucleus, is known as the “strong nuclear force” and is very well named.

#### Coulomb’s Law: Vector Form
So far we have considered only the magnitude of the force exerted by one charge on another, determined according to Coulomb's law. Force, being a vector, has directional properties as well. In the case of Coulomb’s law, the direction of the force is determined by the relative sign of the two electric charges.

As illustrated in Fig. 25-9, suppose we have two point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ separated by a distance $r_{12}$. For the moment, we assume the two charges to have the same sign, so that they repel one another. Let us consider the force on particle 1 exerted by particle 2, which we write in our usual form as $\vec{F}_{12}$. The position vector that locates particle 1 relative to particle 2 is $\vec{r}_{12}$; that is, if we were to define the origin of our coordinate system at the location of particle 2, then $\vec{r}_{12}$ would be the position vector of particle 1.

If the two charges have the same sign, then the force is repulsive and, as shown in Fig. 25-9a, $\vec{F}_{12}$ must be parallel to $\vec{r}_{12}$. If the charges have opposite signs, as in Fig. 25-9b, then the force $\vec{F}_{12}$ is attractive and antiparallel to $\vec{r}_{12}$. In either case, we can represent the force as 
$$
\vec{F}_{12}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}} \hat{r}_{12} \quad (25-5)
$$

Here $r_{12}$ represents the magnitude of the vector $\vec{r}_{12}$, and $\hat{r}_{12}$ indicates the unit vector in the direction of $\vec{r}_{12}$. That is, 
$$
\hat{r}_{12}=\frac{\vec{r}_{12}}{r_{12}} \quad (25-6)
$$

We used a form similar to Eq. 25-5 to express the gravitational force (see Eqs. 14-2 and 14-3).

One other feature is apparent from Fig. 25-9. According to Newton’s third law, the force exerted on particle 2 by particle 1, $\vec{F}_{21}$, is opposite to $\vec{F}_{12}$. This force can then be expressed in exactly the same form: 
$$
\vec{F}_{21}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{21}^{2}} \hat{r}_{21} \quad (25-7)
$$

Here $\hat{r}_{21}$ is a unit vector that points from particle 1 to particle 2; that is, it would be the unit vector in the direction of particle 2 if the origin of coordinates were at the location of particle 1.

The vector form of Coulomb's law is useful because it carries within it the directional information about $\vec{F}$ and whether the force is attractive or repulsive. Using the vector form is of critical importance when we consider the forces acting on an assembly of more than two charges. In this case, Eq. 25-5 would hold for every pair of charges, and the total force on any one charge would be found by taking the vector sum of the forces due to each of the other charges. For example, the force on particle 1 in an assembly would be 
$$
\vec{F}_{1}=\vec{F}_{12}+\vec{F}_{13}+\vec{F}_{14}+\cdots \quad (25-8)
$$
where $\vec{F}_{12}$ is the force on particle 1 from particle 2, $\vec{F}_{13}$ is the force on particle 1 from particle 3, and so on. Equation 25-8 is the mathematical representation of the principle of superposition applied to electric forces. It asserts that the force acting on one charge due to another is independent of whether or not other charges are present, and therefore we can calculate the force separately for each pair of charges and then take their vector sum to find the net force on any charge. For instance, the force $\vec{F}_{13}$ that particle 3 exerts on particle 1 is completely unaffected by the presence of particle 2. The principle of superposition is not at all obvious and may fail in the case of very strong electric forces. Only through experiment can its applicability be verified. For all situations we meet in this text, however, the principle of superposition is valid.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-5
Figure 25-10 shows three charged particles, held in place by forces not shown. What electrostatic force, due to the other two charges, acts on $q_{1}$? Take $q_{1}=-1.2 \mu C$, $q_{2}=+3.7 \mu C$, $q_{3}=-2.3 \mu C$, $r_{12}=15 cm$, $r_{13}=10 cm$, and $\theta=32^{\circ}$.

**Solution** This problem calls for the use of the superposition principle. We start by computing the magnitudes of the forces that $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ exert on $q_{1}$. We substitute the magnitudes of the charges into Eq. 25-5: 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{12}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r_{12}^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.2 × 10^{-6} C)(3.7 × 10^{-6} C)}{(0.15 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=1.77 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

The charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ have opposite signs so that the force exerted by $q_{2}$ on $q_{1}$ is attractive. Hence $\vec{F}_{12}$ points to the right in Fig. 25-10.

We also have 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{13}&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.2 × 10^{-6} C)(2.3 × 10^{-6} C)}{(0.10 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=2.48 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

These two charges have the same (negative) sign so that the force exerted by $q_{3}$ on $q_{1}$ is repulsive. Thus $\vec{F}_{13}$ points as shown in Fig. 25-10.

The components of the resultant force $\vec{F}_{1}$ acting on $q_{1}$ are determined by the corresponding components of Eq. 25-8, or 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{1x}&=F_{12x}+F_{13x}=F_{12}+F_{13}\sin\theta \\ 
&=1.77 N+(2.48 N)(\sin32^{\circ})=3.08 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

and
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{1y}&=F_{12y}+F_{13y}=0-F_{13}\cos\theta \\ 
&=-(2.48 N)(\cos32^{\circ})=-2.10 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

From these components, you can show that the magnitude of $\vec{F}_{1}$ is 3.73 N and that this vector makes an angle of -34° with the x-axis.

### 25-4 库仑定律
本章到目前为止，我们已经确定存在两种电荷，且电荷之间会相互施加作用力。现在，我们的目标是理解这种作用力的本质。

首位成功通过定量实验研究电荷间作用力的科学家是查尔斯·奥古斯汀·库仑（1736-1806）。他测量了电荷间的吸引力与排斥力，并推导出了支配这种作用力的定律。从原理上看，库仑使用的装置与图25-2类似，不同之处在于他采用了图25-8中标记为a和b的小型带电球体。

当a和b带电时，作用在a上的电场力会使悬丝发生扭转。库仑通过旋转悬丝顶端，将悬丝扭转角度θ，以抵消这种扭转效应，从而使两个电荷保持在特定的间距。此时，角度θ可作为作用在电荷a上电场力的相对度量。图25-8所示的装置是扭秤；后来卡文迪许在测量万有引力时（第14-3节），也使用了类似的装置。

库仑及其同时代科学家的实验表明：一个带电体对另一个带电体施加的电场力，与两个电荷的电荷量大小的乘积成正比，与它们之间距离的平方成反比。即：
$$F \propto \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$$

式中，F是作用在两个电荷$q_{1}$和$q_{2}$上的相互作用力的大小，r是两个电荷中心之间的距离。每个电荷受到的来自另一个电荷的作用力，沿两电荷中心的连线方向。根据牛顿第三定律，即使两个电荷的电荷量大小不同，$q_{1}$对$q_{2}$的作用力与$q_{2}$对$q_{1}$的作用力，也始终大小相等、方向相反。

为将上述比例关系转化为等式，我们引入比例常数K，称为库仑常数。由此可得到电荷间作用力的表达式：
$$F=K \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$$

式（25-2）被称为库仑定律，它通常仅适用于带电体尺寸远小于电荷间距离的情况。我们常说，库仑定律仅对点电荷成立。

我们对库仑定律的信任，并非仅基于库仑实验的定量结果。例如，这类实验无法证明式（25-2）中r的指数恰好为2，而非2.0001。在第27-7节中我们将介绍，库仑定律也可通过间接实验推导得出，该实验表明：若式（25-2）中r的指数并非恰好为2，其与2的偏差也至多不超过$1 × 10^{-16}$。

库仑定律与牛顿的万有引力平方反比定律（$F=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$）相似，而在库仑进行实验时，万有引力定律已提出100年。两者均为平方反比定律：在库仑定律中，电荷量q的作用与万有引力定律中质量m的作用相同。但两者存在一个关键区别：万有引力始终是吸引力，而静电力既可以是吸引力（异种电荷之间），也可以是排斥力（同种电荷之间），具体取决于两个电荷的正负性。

在国际单位制（SI）中，库仑常数K采用以下形式表示：
$$K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \quad (25-3)$$

尽管将K表示为这种形式看似使库仑定律变得复杂，但最终会简化电磁学中更常用的其他公式（相比库仑定律而言）。

常数$\epsilon_{0}$被称为电常数（也称为介电常数），其数值由光速决定（我们将在第39章讨论这一关系）。它的精确值为：
$$\epsilon_{0}=8.85418781762 × 10^{-12} C^{2}/(N·m^{2})$$

相应地，库仑常数K的数值（保留三位有效数字）为：
$$K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2}$$

当K取上述数值时，若电荷量q以库仑（C）为单位、距离r以米（m）为单位，则计算得出的作用力F以牛顿（N）为单位。

库仑定律的意义远不止描述带电球体之间的作用力。当库仑定律融入量子物理框架时，它能准确描述以下三种作用力：（1）将原子中的电子束缚在原子核周围的电场力；（2）使原子结合形成分子的电场力；（3）使原子和分子结合形成固体或液体的电场力。因此，我们日常生活中感受到的、非引力性质的力，大多是电场力。

#### 例题25-2
在例题25-1中我们已知，一枚铜制便士硬币内含有等量的正电荷和负电荷，每种电荷的大小均为$1.37 × 10^{5} C$。假设将这两部分电荷分别集中成两个电荷束，且两电荷束相距100米，那么作用在每个电荷束上的吸引力大小是多少？

**解答** 根据式（25-4）可得：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{|q|^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.37 × 10^{5} C)^{2}}{(100 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=1.69 × 10^{16} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

这个力的大小约为$2 × 10^{12}$吨！即便两电荷束的间距为地球直径（约12742千米），它们之间的吸引力仍约为120吨。不过，我们回避了一个问题：如何将分离的电荷形成“电荷束”，且电荷束的尺寸远小于它们之间的间距。即便真能形成这样的电荷束，它们也会因彼此间巨大的库仑排斥力而瞬间溃散。

该例题带来的启示是：普通物质的电中性很难被显著打破。若试图从物体中分离出占比可观的电荷，会立即产生巨大的库仑力，将分离的电荷重新拉回物体，恢复电中性。

#### 例题25-3
氢原子中电子与质子的平均距离r约为$5.3 × 10^{-11} m$。（a）这两个粒子之间的平均静电力大小是多少？（b）这两个粒子之间的平均万有引力大小是多少？

**（a）解答** 根据式（25-4），静电力大小为：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{e}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.60 × 10^{-19} C)^{2}}{(5.3 × 10^{-11} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=8.2 × 10^{-8} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

尽管这个力看似微小（约等于一粒尘埃的重量），但它能使原子内的电子产生极大的加速度，约为$10^{23} m/s^{2}$。

**（b）解答** 万有引力大小为：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{g}&=G \frac{m_{e}m_{p}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(6.67 × 10^{-11} N·m^{2}/kg^{2})(9.11 × 10^{-31} kg)(1.67 × 10^{-27} kg)}{(5.3 × 10^{-11} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=3.6 × 10^{-47} N 
\end{aligned}
$$

可见，万有引力比静电力弱约$10^{39}$倍。尽管万有引力很弱，但它始终是吸引力，因此能逐步聚集巨大质量（如形成恒星和星系），进而产生强大的万有引力。而静电力对同种电荷表现为排斥力，无法使大量正电荷或负电荷集中聚集——正负电荷通常会共同存在，彼此大幅抵消。我们日常生活中接触到的电荷，不过是这种整体电中性平衡的微小扰动。

#### 例题25-4
铁原子核的半径约为$4 × 10^{-15} m$，且含有26个质子。若原子核内两个质子的间距等于原子核半径，那么它们之间的排斥静电力大小是多少？

**解答** 根据式（25-4）可得：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.60 × 10^{-19} C)^{2}}{(4 × 10^{-15} m)^{2}} \\ 
&=14 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

这个作用在单个质子上的排斥静电力高达14牛（约3磅），必须由一种吸引力来平衡，才能使原子核保持稳定——这种力就是核力。核力的作用范围极短，在原子核外极近的距离外就几乎无法察觉，它被称为“强核力”，这个名称十分贴切（因其强度极大）。

#### 库仑定律的矢量形式
到目前为止，我们仅讨论了根据库仑定律计算的电荷间作用力的大小。但力是矢量，还具有方向性。在库仑定律中，作用力的方向由两个电荷的正负关系决定。

如图25-9所示，假设两个点电荷$q_{1}$和$q_{2}$之间的距离为$r_{12}$。先假设两个电荷为同种电荷，彼此相互排斥。我们考虑粒子2对粒子1施加的作用力，按常规表示为$\vec{F}_{12}$。定位粒子1相对于粒子2的位置矢量为$\vec{r}_{12}$——也就是说，若以粒子2的位置为坐标系原点，那么$\vec{r}_{12}$就是粒子1的位置矢量。

若两个电荷为同种电荷，作用力为排斥力，如图25-9a所示，$\vec{F}_{12}$与$\vec{r}_{12}$平行；若两个电荷为异种电荷（图25-9b），作用力为吸引力，$\vec{F}_{12}$与$\vec{r}_{12}$反平行。无论哪种情况，作用力均可表示为：
$$
\vec{F}_{12}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}} \hat{r}_{12} \quad (25-5)
$$

式中，$r_{12}$是位置矢量$\vec{r}_{12}$的大小，$\hat{r}_{12}$是沿$\vec{r}_{12}$方向的单位矢量，即：
$$
\hat{r}_{12}=\frac{\vec{r}_{12}}{r_{12}} \quad (25-6)
$$

我们曾用类似式（25-5）的形式表示万有引力（见式14-2和14-3）。

从图25-9中还可看出另一个特点：根据牛顿第三定律，粒子1对粒子2施加的作用力$\vec{F}_{21}$与$\vec{F}_{12}$方向相反，其表达式与$\vec{F}_{12}$形式完全相同：
$$
\vec{F}_{21}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{21}^{2}} \hat{r}_{21} \quad (25-7)
$$

式中，$\hat{r}_{21}$是沿粒子1指向粒子2方向的单位矢量——即若以粒子1的位置为坐标系原点，$\hat{r}_{21}$就是沿粒子2方向的单位矢量。

库仑定律的矢量形式非常有用，因为它既包含了作用力$\vec{F}$的方向信息，也体现了作用力是吸引力还是排斥力。当研究两个以上电荷组成的系统中各电荷受到的作用力时，矢量形式至关重要。此时，式（25-5）适用于任意一对电荷，任意一个电荷受到的总作用力，等于其他每个电荷对它施加作用力的矢量和。例如，系统中粒子1受到的总作用力为：
$$
\vec{F}_{1}=\vec{F}_{12}+\vec{F}_{13}+\vec{F}_{14}+\cdots \quad (25-8)
$$
其中，$\vec{F}_{12}$是粒子2对粒子1的作用力，$\vec{F}_{13}$是粒子3对粒子1的作用力，以此类推。式（25-8）是电场力叠加原理的数学表达，它指出：一个电荷受到另一个电荷的作用力，与是否存在其他电荷无关。因此，我们可分别计算每对电荷之间的作用力，再通过矢量求和得到任意一个电荷受到的净作用力。例如，粒子3对粒子1的作用力$\vec{F}_{13}$，完全不受粒子2存在的影响。叠加原理并非显而易见，在极强电场力的情况下可能不成立，其适用性需通过实验验证。但在本书涉及的所有场景中，叠加原理均成立。

#### 例题25-5
图25-10展示了三个带电粒子（它们被未画出的力固定在原位）。在另外两个电荷的作用下，粒子$q_{1}$受到的静电力大小和方向是多少？已知$q_{1}=-1.2 \mu C$、$q_{2}=+3.7 \mu C$、$q_{3}=-2.3 \mu C$、$r_{12}=15 cm$、$r_{13}=10 cm$，且$\theta=32^{\circ}$。

**解答** 本题需运用叠加原理。首先计算$q_{2}$和$q_{3}$分别对$q_{1}$施加的作用力大小，将电荷大小代入式（25-5）：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{12}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r_{12}^{2}} \\ 
&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.2 × 10^{-6} C)(3.7 × 10^{-6} C)}{(0.15 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=1.77 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

由于$q_{1}$与$q_{2}$为异种电荷，$q_{2}$对$q_{1}$的作用力为吸引力，因此$\vec{F}_{12}$在图25-10中指向右侧。

同理，$q_{3}$对$q_{1}$的作用力大小为：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{13}&=\frac{(8.99 × 10^{9} N·m^{2}/C^{2})(1.2 × 10^{-6} C)(2.3 × 10^{-6} C)}{(0.10 m)^{2}} \\ 
&=2.48 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

由于$q_{1}$与$q_{3}$为同种电荷（均为负电），$q_{3}$对$q_{1}$的作用力为排斥力，因此$\vec{F}_{13}$的方向如图25-10所示。

根据式（25-8），$q_{1}$受到的合作用力$\vec{F}_{1}$的分量由各分力的分量决定，即：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{1x}&=F_{12x}+F_{13x}=F_{12}+F_{13}\sin\theta \\ 
&=1.77 N+(2.48 N)(\sin32^{\circ})=3.08 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

以及
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_{1y}&=F_{12y}+F_{13y}=0-F_{13}\cos\theta \\ 
&=-(2.48 N)(\cos32^{\circ})=-2.10 N 
\end{aligned}
$$

由上述分量可计算出，合作用力$\vec{F}_{1}$的大小为3.73牛，且该矢量与x轴的夹角为-34°（即位于第四象限，与x轴正方向夹角34°向下）。


### 25-5 CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS
So far we have seen how to calculate the forces due to point charges. In many applications, however, electric forces are exerted by charged objects in the form of rods, plates, or solids. For simplicity we assume that the objects are insulators and that charge is spread throughout the surface or volume of the object, forming a continuous charge distribution.

Figure 25-2 showed forces exerted by one charged rod on another. Coulomb's law applies only to point charges, and we therefore cannot use Coulomb's law in its point charge form to calculate the force exerted by one charged rod on the other. It is possible to imagine the rods to be covered with point charges and to use Coulomb's law to calculate the force exerted by each point charge of one rod on each point charge of the other, but such an approach would be hopelessly complicated—if the rods carry the small charge of only 1 nC, it would be necessary to consider $10^{10}$ point charges on each rod!

Instead, we return to an idea from Franklin’s time and regard the charge as a continuous property. The basic procedure is to divide the charge into infinitesimal elements and use the methods of calculus to find the total force due to all the elements.

If an object contains a net charge q, we imagine it to be divided into many small elements $dq$. Each element has a certain length, area, or volume, depending on whether we are considering charges that are respectively distributed in one, two, or three dimensions. We express $dq$ in terms of the size of the element and the charge density, which describes how the charges are distributed over the length, area, or volume of the object. For most of the problems we consider in this text, the charges will be distributed uniformly over the object, which means that the charge density has the same value everywhere on the object.

In some situations, charges are distributed in one dimension, such as the thin charged rods of Fig. 25-2. In this case, we express $dq$ in terms of the linear charge density (charge per unit length) $\lambda$ whose basic unit is C/m. A small element of the rod of length $dx$ has a charge $dq$ given by 
$$dq=\lambda dx \quad (25-9)$$

If the rod is uniformly charged, so that a total charge q is spread evenly over its length L, then $\lambda=q/L$. For example, a rod of length $L=0.12$ m carrying a uniformly distributed charge of $q=5.4 × 10^{-6} C$ has a linear charge density of $\lambda=q/L=4.5 × 10^{-5} C/m$. A short piece of the rod of length $dx=1.0$ mm would then carry a charge $dq=\lambda dx=4.5 × 10^{-8} C$.

In other situations, charge might be distributed over a two-dimensional area, such as the surface of the carrier bead in Fig. 25-3. In this case, $dq$ is expressed in terms of the surface charge density (charge per unit area) $\sigma$ measured in the SI unit of $C/m^2$. A small element of area $dA$ would then have a charge given by 
$$dq=\sigma dA \quad (25-10)$$

If a charge q is spread uniformly over a surface of area A, then $\sigma=q/A$.

The charge also might be spread throughout the volume of a three-dimensional object. In this case, we use the volume charge density (charge per unit volume) $\rho$ whose SI unit is $C/m^3$. The charge $dq$ in an element of volume $dV$ would then be 
$$dq=\rho dV \quad (25-11)$$

If the charge q is distributed uniformly throughout the volume V, then $\rho=q/V$.

To illustrate these concepts, we will calculate expressions for the force exerted by a continuous charge distribution on a point charge $q_0$. By extending these methods, it is possible to calculate the force exerted by one continuous charge distribution on another.

The procedure for finding the force exerted by a continuous charge distribution on a point charge is as follows:
1. Imagine the continuous charge distribution to be divided into a large number of small charge elements.
2. Pick an arbitrary charge element and express its charge $dq$ in terms of Eq. 25-9, 25-10, or 25-11, depending respectively on whether the charge is distributed over a line, an area, or a volume.
3. Because $dq$ is infinitesimally small, we can treat it as a point charge. Express the magnitude of the force element $dF$ exerted by the charge $dq$ on the charge $q_0$ in terms of Coulomb's law, Eq. 25-4: 
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|dq||q_0|}{r^2} \quad (25-12)$$
where r is the distance between $dq$ and $q_0$.
4. By taking into account the signs and locations of $dq$ and $q_0$, determine the direction of the force element $d\vec{F}$.
5. The total force is then found by adding all the infinitesimal force elements, which involves the integral 
$$\vec{F}=\int d\vec{F} \quad (25-13)$$

In performing this integral, we usually need to take into account that different charge elements $dq$ may give force elements $d\vec{F}$ in different directions. Equation 25-13 really means three different equations for the three components of $\vec{F}$: 
$$F_x=\int dF_x, F_y=\int dF_y, F_z=\int dF_z \quad (25-14)$$

Occasionally we can use arguments based on symmetry to avoid calculating one or two of these integrals.

#### A Uniform Line of Charge
Figure 25-11 shows a thin rod of length L that lies along the z axis and carries a uniformly distributed positive charge q, so that its linear charge density is $\lambda=q/L$. We want to find the force exerted by the rod on a positive point charge $q_0$ located on the perpendicular bisector of the rod (the positive y axis) a distance y from its center.

The figure shows the results of performing steps 1, 2, and 3 of our procedure. We imagine the rod divided into small elements of length $dz$. An arbitrary element of charge $dq=\lambda dz$ is located a distance z from its center and exerts a force $dF$ on $q_0$, where 
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 dq}{r^2}$$

The direction of the force $d\vec{F}$ is shown in the figure. There is no component of $d\vec{F}$ in the x direction (perpendicular to the page), so $F_x=0$. We can also use a symmetry argument to show that $F_z=0$. For every charge element $dq$ located at position $+z$, there is another charge element $dq$ located at $-z$. When we add the forces due to the charge elements at $+z$ and $-z$, we find that the z components have equal magnitudes but point in opposite directions, so their sum is zero. Because the charge $q_0$ is located in the median plane of the rod, this cancellation will occur for every such pair of charge elements along the entire length of the rod. We therefore conclude that $F_z=0$.

Only $F_y$ remains to be calculated. The element $dF_y=dF\cos\theta$ is shown in Fig. 25-11. With $dq=\lambda dz$, $r^2=y^2+z^2$, and $\cos\theta=y/r$, we have 
$$dF_y=dF\cos\theta=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda dz}{(y^2+z^2)} \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2}}$$
$$F_y=\int dF_y=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} q_0 \lambda y \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{dz}{(y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$

Evaluating the integral (see Appendix I and note that y is a constant), we obtain 
$$F_y=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{y \sqrt{y^2+L^2/4}} \quad (25-15)$$

This force is in the positive y direction when $q_0$ and q are positive. If the charge $q_0$ is moved to other locations in the xy plane, the expression for the force may change (see Exercise 14).

It is often instructive to evaluate expressions such as this one in various limiting cases. Let us consider the result when $y \gg L$, in which case the force becomes 
$$F_y \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{y^2}$$
which is just the expression for the force of one point charge on another. When we are very far from the charged rod, or when the rod is very small, it looks like a point charge.

#### A Ring of Charge
Figure 25-12 shows a thin ring of radius R carrying a uniformly distributed positive charge q, so that its linear charge density is $\lambda=q/(2\pi R)$. We wish to find the force exerted by the ring on a positive point charge $q_0$ located on the axis of the ring (which we choose as the positive z axis) a distance z from the center of the ring. A small charge element of the ring has a length $R d\phi$ and thus carries a charge $dq=\lambda R d\phi$. The force $dF$ exerted on $q_0$ by $dq$ is 
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 dq}{r^2}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R d\phi}{(z^2+R^2)}$$

We can use a symmetry argument to establish that the only nonzero component of $\vec{F}$ is its z component. For every element $dq$ of the ring, there will be another element of equal charge $dq$ at the opposite end of a diameter through the center of the ring; when the force elements on $q_0$ due to these two charge elements are added, all force components other than $F_z$ will cancel. With $\cos\theta=z/r$, we find 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_z&=\int dF_z=\int dF\cos\theta \\ 
&=\int \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R d\phi}{(z^2+R^2)} \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}} \\ 
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R z}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi 
\end{aligned}
$$

The integral evaluated around the ring gives $2\pi$, and so the final result for the force is 
$$F_z=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q z}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \quad (25-16)$$

Is this result also valid if $q_0$ is located on the negative z axis? (See Exercise 15.)

We can examine this result in the limiting case as $z \gg R$. For $z \gg R$, we obtain 
$$F_z \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{z^2}$$
which again gives the result for point charges. When we are very far from the ring, it appears to be a point charge.

Note also that $F_z=0$ for $z=0$. This is reasonable, because at the center of the ring the charge $q_0$ would be pushed equally in all directions by the charge elements that make up the ring.

#### A Disk of Charge
Figure 25-13 shows a circular disk of radius R that carries a positive charge q uniformly distributed over its surface, so that its surface charge density is $\sigma=q/(\pi R^2)$. A positive point charge $q_0$ is located on the axis of the disk (the positive z axis) a distance z from the center of the disk. To find the force exerted by the disk on the point charge, we can divide the disk into a series of concentric rings. The charge on the ring of radius w and thickness dw shown in Fig. 25-13 is $dq=\sigma dA=\sigma(2\pi w dw)=2\pi\sigma w dw$. The force $dF_z$ on $q_0$ exerted by this ring can be found using Eq. 25-16 with q replaced by $dq$ and R replaced with w: 
$$dF_z=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0(2\pi\sigma w dw) z}{(z^2+w^2)^{3/2}}$$

To add the force elements due to all of the rings, we integrate as w ranges from 0 to R: 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_z&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} q_0 2\pi\sigma z \int_{0}^{R} \frac{w dw}{(z^2+w^2)^{3/2}} \\ 
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{2 q_0 q}{R^2} \left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}}\right) \quad (25-17)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the integral is of the form $\int u^{-3/2} du$, which can be evaluated directly. How would this equation differ for $z<0$? (See Exercise 15.) As $z \to \infty$, you can use the binomial expansion (see Appendix I) to show that this expression reduces to Coulomb’s law for point charges.

In these three examples, we have assumed that all charges are positive. If either the point charge or the extended object (but not both!) carry negative charge, the direction of the force is opposite to what is shown in Figs. 25-11 to 25-13.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-6
Two circular disks of radius $R=5.0$ cm are separated by 6.0 cm along a common vertical axis. The disks carry equal but opposite electric charges distributed uniformly over their surfaces. How much charge q must be placed on each disk to suspend a tiny drop of oil of mass $4.0 × 10^{-15}$ kg and charge $-e$ at a point along the axis of the disks and midway between them?

**Solution** Let the top disk be positively charged and the bottom disk be negatively charged. Then the top disk attracts the drop and the bottom disk repels it. Because the drop is midway between the disks, the forces have the same magnitude $F_z$ given by Eq. 25-17. To hold the drop in equilibrium, the net upward electrostatic force $2F_z$ must equal the weight mg of the drop. Setting these two forces equal and using Eq. 25-17, we obtain
$$q=\frac{m g}{\frac{4 e}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R^2} \left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}}\right)}$$

Solving, we find $q=35$ nC.

This method was used by Robert A. Millikan in a series of experiments begun in 1906 to measure the charge of the electron. (See Section 26-6.)

#### A Special Case
There is one special case in which a continuous charge distribution can be treated as a point charge, which allows us to use Coulomb’s law in its point-charge form. This occurs when the charge is distributed with spherical symmetry. That is, the volume charge density may vary with radius, but the density is uniform in a thin shell at any radius.

First we consider a thin spherical shell. In Section 14-5 we established two properties of the gravitational force exerted by a uniformly dense spherical shell of matter on a point mass. These properties are: (1) the force on a particle inside the shell is zero, and (2) the force on an external particle is the same as if the entire mass of the shell were concentrated at its center.

The symmetry between the gravitational and electrostatic force laws (both depend on $1/r^2$) will allow us to make many analogies between gravitation and electrostatics. We can often apply results from gravitation directly to electrostatics without additional calculation or proof. This is true for the properties of uniform shells. The proofs of these two important results for electrostatics follow exactly the corresponding proofs in Section 14-5 for the gravitational force.

- A uniformly charged spherical shell exerts no electrostatic force on a point charge located anywhere inside the shell.
- A uniformly charged spherical shell exerts an electrostatic force on a point charge outside the shell as if all the charge of the shell were concentrated in a point charge at its center.

There is one difference between the gravitational and electrostatic cases: the gravitational force is always attractive, but the electrostatic force may be either attractive or repulsive. However, this difference does not affect the transfer of the above two rules from the gravitational to the electrostatic force.

These rules can be used to obtain a related result that is valid for spherical charge distributions. Suppose we have a spherical distribution of charge in which the volume charge density $\rho$ is either constant or varies only as a function of the radius r. We can therefore regard the sphere as being composed of a set of thin spherical shells. Each shell is uniformly charged; that is, the charge density of one shell may differ from the charge density of another shell, but on each individual shell the charge is uniformly distributed. Then we can apply each of the two rules to every shell of the sphere. If our test charge is somewhere inside the sphere, the shells outside of the charge exert no force on it according to the first rule. (This result was used for the gravitational force in Sample Problem 14-4.) If the test charge is outside the sphere, then every shell can be replaced by a point charge at the center, and so the entire sphere can be replaced by a point charge equal to the total charge of the sphere.

For this reason the force exerted by the nucleus of an atom on its electrons generally cannot give us any information about the distribution of positive charge within the nucleus. For spherical nuclei in which the charge density depends only on r, all charge distributions give identical forces on an electron outside the nucleus. However, occasionally an electron may wander inside the nucleus and give us information about its distribution of positive charge.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 25-7
The spherical nucleus of a certain atom contains a positive charge $Ze$ in a volume of radius R. Compare the force exerted on an electron inside the nucleus at radius $0.5R$ with the force at radius R for a nucleus in which (a) the charge density is constant throughout its volume, and (b) the charge density increases in direct proportion to the radius r.

**Solution (a)** For the uniformly charged nucleus (which is a good approximation to the behavior of many nuclei), the volume charge density is 
$$
\rho=\frac{q}{V}=\frac{Ze}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
$$

When the electron is at $r=R$, the entire nucleus can be replaced by a point charge $q=Ze$ located at its center, so the force $F(r)$ at $r=R$ is 
$$
F(R)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{R^2}
$$

When the electron is at $r=R/2$, the charge at all larger radii exerts no force on the electron (by the first rule for spherical shells). The charge inside $R/2$ can be replaced with a point charge. How much charge is inside $R/2$? Since the volume of a sphere depends on $r^3$, the volume inside $r=R/2$ is $(1/2)^3=1/8$ the volume of the sphere. So the charge inside $r=R/2$ is 1/8 the charge of the entire sphere, and we conclude that 
$$
\frac{F(R/2)}{F(R)}=\frac{1}{8}
$$

**(b)** We can write the charge density as $\rho(r)=br$. First we must evaluate the constant of proportionality b. We know that the total charge on the nucleus must be $Ze$, so 
$$
\int_{0}^{R} \rho dV=\int_{0}^{R}(br) 4\pi r^2 dr=Ze
$$
where $dV=4\pi r^2 dr$ is the volume of a spherical shell. Carrying out the integral, we find $b=Ze/(\pi R^4)$.

From the second rule for spherical shells, we know that the force $F(R)$ is the same for both charge distributions. However, $F(R/2)$ will be different for the two distributions. To find $F(R/2)$, we need to know how much charge $q'$ is contained within the sphere of radius $R/2$, since the charge outside of radius $R/2$ exerts no force on the electron. This charge is 
$$
q'=\int_{0}^{R/2} \rho dV=\int_{0}^{R/2} \frac{Ze r}{\pi R^4} 4\pi r^2 dr=\frac{Ze}{16}
$$

The force on the electron at $r=R/2$ can be found by replacing the sphere within $R/2$ by a point charge $q'$ at its center, which gives a force 1/16 the force at the surface: 
$$
\frac{F(R/2)}{F(R)}=\frac{1}{16}
$$

This result is very different from that of the uniform sphere in part (a), demonstrating that, although the electron outside the nucleus cannot distinguish between the two distributions, the electron inside clearly can.

Atomic electrons can occasionally penetrate the nucleus, and electrons can be fired into the nucleus by an accelerator. These two methods can give us information about the distribution of charge within the nucleus. One result of these experiments is that the charge density is found to be very nearly uniform for most nuclei. Despite the Coulomb repulsion of the protons (which is expected to drive them toward the nuclear surface) and despite the strong nuclear force between the protons (which is expected to make them congregate near the center of the nucleus), the protons in the nucleus are distributed with a roughly uniform density. Furthermore, this density is approximately the same for light nuclei as it is for heavy nuclei. These surprising results offer insight into important properties of the nuclear force.

### 25-5 连续电荷分布
到目前为止，我们已经掌握了点电荷间作用力的计算方法。但在许多实际应用中，电场力由呈杆状、板状或块状的带电物体施加。为简化分析，我们假设这些物体为绝缘体，且电荷均匀分布在其表面或内部，形成连续电荷分布。

图25-2展示了一根带电杆对另一根带电杆施加的作用力。由于库仑定律仅适用于点电荷，我们无法直接用点电荷形式的库仑定律计算两根带电杆之间的作用力。尽管我们可以想象将杆表面划分为无数点电荷，再用库仑定律计算一根杆上每个点电荷对另一根杆上每个点电荷的作用力，但这种方法极为复杂——即使杆上仅带1纳库的少量电荷，每根杆也需划分出$10^{10}$个点电荷！

因此，我们回归富兰克林时代的思路，将电荷视为连续属性。基本方法是将连续电荷分割为无数电荷元，再利用微积分计算所有电荷元产生的总作用力。

若某物体带有净电荷q，我们可将其想象成由大量小电荷元$dq$组成。根据电荷分布的维度（一维、二维或三维），每个电荷元对应一定的长度、面积或体积。我们用电荷元的尺寸与电荷密度（描述电荷在物体长度、面积或体积上的分布情况）来表示$dq$。本书涉及的大部分问题中，电荷均为均匀分布，即物体各位置的电荷密度大小相同。

在某些情况下，电荷呈一维分布（如图25-2中的细带电杆）。此时，我们用线电荷密度$\lambda$（单位长度的电荷量，基本单位为C/m）表示$dq$。对于长度为$dx$的杆状电荷元，其电荷量为：
$$dq=\lambda dx \quad (25-9)$$

若杆上电荷均匀分布，总电荷量q均匀分布在长度L上，则线电荷密度$\lambda=q/L$。例如，一根长度$L=0.12$米、带均匀电荷$q=5.4 × 10^{-6}$库的杆，其线电荷密度$\lambda=q/L=4.5 × 10^{-5}$库/米；取该杆上一段长度$dx=1.0$毫米的电荷元，其电荷量$dq=\lambda dx=4.5 × 10^{-8}$库。

在另一些情况下，电荷呈二维分布（如图25-3中载体珠的表面）。此时，我们用面电荷密度$\sigma$（单位面积的电荷量，国际单位为$C/m^2$）表示$dq$。对于面积为$dA$的面状电荷元，其电荷量为：
$$dq=\sigma dA \quad (25-10)$$

若总电荷量q均匀分布在面积A的表面上，则面电荷密度$\sigma=q/A$。

电荷还可能呈三维分布（即分布在物体内部）。此时，我们用体电荷密度$\rho$（单位体积的电荷量，国际单位为$C/m^3$）表示$dq$。对于体积为$dV$的体状电荷元，其电荷量为：
$$dq=\rho dV \quad (25-11)$$

若总电荷量q均匀分布在体积V的物体内，则体电荷密度$\rho=q/V$。

为阐明这些概念，我们将推导连续电荷分布对某点电荷$q_0$的作用力表达式。通过扩展这些方法，还可计算两个连续电荷分布之间的作用力。

连续电荷分布对某点电荷的作用力计算步骤如下：
1. 将连续电荷分布分割为大量小电荷元。
2. 选取任意一个电荷元，根据电荷分布的维度（一维、二维或三维），分别用式（25-9）、（25-10）或（25-11）表示其电荷量$dq$。
3. 由于$dq$为无限小量，可将其视为点电荷。根据库仑定律（式25-4），该电荷元对$q_0$的作用力大小为：
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|dq||q_0|}{r^2} \quad (25-12)$$
式中，r为电荷元$dq$与点电荷$q_0$之间的距离。
4. 根据$dq$与$q_0$的正负性及位置关系，确定作用力元$d\vec{F}$的方向。
5. 总作用力为所有作用力元的矢量和，需通过积分计算：
$$\vec{F}=\int d\vec{F} \quad (25-13)$$

计算积分时，通常需考虑不同电荷元的作用力元$d\vec{F}$可能具有不同方向。因此，式（25-13）实际对应总作用力$\vec{F}$在三个坐标轴上的分量积分：
$$F_x=\int dF_x, F_y=\int dF_y, F_z=\int dF_z \quad (25-14)$$

有时可利用对称性分析，避免计算其中一个或两个分量的积分。

#### 均匀带电细杆
图25-11所示为一根长度为L的细杆，沿z轴放置且带均匀正电荷q，其线电荷密度$\lambda=q/L$。我们需要计算该杆对位于其垂直平分线上（正y轴方向）、与杆中心距离为y的正点电荷$q_0$的作用力。

图中展示了上述计算步骤1、2、3的结果：将杆分割为多个长度为$dz$的小电荷元，任意电荷元的电荷量$dq=\lambda dz$，位于距杆中心z处，对$q_0$的作用力大小为：
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 dq}{r^2}$$

作用力元$d\vec{F}$的方向如图所示。由于$d\vec{F}$在x方向（垂直于纸面）无分量，故$F_x=0$。利用对称性分析还可证明$F_z=0$：对于任意位于$+z$处的电荷元$dq$，总有一个对称的电荷元$dq$位于$-z$处，两者对$q_0$的作用力在z方向的分量大小相等、方向相反，相互抵消。由于$q_0$位于杆的中垂面上，杆上所有电荷元均可成对抵消z方向分量，因此总作用力的z分量$F_z=0$。

仅剩y方向分量$F_y$需计算。如图25-11所示，$dF_y=dF\cos\theta$。结合$dq=\lambda dz$、$r^2=y^2+z^2$及$\cos\theta=y/r$，可得：
$$dF_y=dF\cos\theta=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda dz}{(y^2+z^2)} \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2}}$$
$$F_y=\int dF_y=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} q_0 \lambda y \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{dz}{(y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$

计算积分（见附录I，注意y为常量），最终得到：
$$F_y=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{y \sqrt{y^2+L^2/4}} \quad (25-15)$$

当$q_0$与q均为正时，该作用力沿正y方向。若将$q_0$移至xy平面内其他位置，作用力表达式会发生变化（见习题14）。

对这类表达式进行极限情况分析通常很有意义。当$y \gg L$时，作用力可近似为：
$$F_y \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{y^2}$$
这与点电荷间的作用力表达式完全一致。这表明，当距离远大于杆的长度（或杆本身极短时），带电杆可近似视为点电荷。

#### 均匀带电圆环
图25-12所示为一根半径为R的细圆环，带均匀正电荷q，其线电荷密度$\lambda=q/(2\pi R)$。我们需要计算该圆环对位于其轴线上（取为正z轴）、与圆环中心距离为z的正点电荷$q_0$的作用力。圆环上一长度为$R d\phi$的电荷元，其电荷量$dq=\lambda R d\phi$，对$q_0$的作用力大小为：
$$dF=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 dq}{r^2}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R d\phi}{(z^2+R^2)}$$

利用对称性分析可确定：总作用力$\vec{F}$仅z分量不为零。对于圆环上任意电荷元$dq$，圆环直径另一端总有一个等量电荷元$dq$，两者对$q_0$的作用力在非z方向的分量相互抵消。结合$\cos\theta=z/r$，可得z分量：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_z&=\int dF_z=\int dF\cos\theta \\ 
&=\int \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R d\phi}{(z^2+R^2)} \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}} \\ 
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 \lambda R z}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi 
\end{aligned}
$$

沿圆环一周的积分结果为$2\pi$，因此总作用力的z分量为：
$$F_z=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q z}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}} \quad (25-16)$$

若$q_0$位于负z轴上，该结果是否仍成立？（见习题15）

当$z \gg R$时，对表达式进行极限分析可得：
$$F_z \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0 q}{z^2}$$
再次回归点电荷作用力公式，说明距离远大于圆环半径时，带电圆环可近似视为点电荷。

另需注意，当$z=0$（$q_0$位于圆环中心）时，$F_z=0$。这一结果符合直觉：圆环各电荷元对中心处$q_0$的作用力沿径向均匀分布，相互抵消，故净作用力为零。

#### 均匀带电圆盘
图25-13所示为一个半径为R的圆形圆盘，表面带均匀正电荷q，其面电荷密度$\sigma=q/(\pi R^2)$。正点电荷$q_0$位于圆盘轴线上（正z轴方向），与圆盘中心距离为z。为计算圆盘对$q_0$的作用力，可将圆盘分割为一系列同心细圆环：对于半径为w、宽度为dw的细圆环，其面积$dA=2\pi w dw$，电荷量$dq=\sigma dA=2\pi\sigma w dw$。利用式（25-16）（将q替换为$dq$、R替换为w），可得该圆环对$q_0$的作用力z分量：
$$dF_z=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_0(2\pi\sigma w dw) z}{(z^2+w^2)^{3/2}}$$

对所有圆环的作用力元积分（w从0到R），得到总作用力的z分量：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
F_z&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} q_0 2\pi\sigma z \int_{0}^{R} \frac{w dw}{(z^2+w^2)^{3/2}} \\ 
&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{2 q_0 q}{R^2} \left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}}\right) \quad (25-17)
\end{aligned}
$$

该积分形式为$\int u^{-3/2} du$，可直接计算。若$z<0$，该式会发生怎样的变化？（见习题15）当$z \to \infty$时，利用二项式展开（见附录I）可证明，该表达式会简化为点电荷的库仑定律公式。

上述三个例子均假设所有电荷为正。若点电荷与扩展带电体中仅有一个带负电（非两者均带负电），则作用力方向与图25-11至图25-13所示方向相反。

#### 例题25-6
两个半径$R=5.0$厘米的圆形圆盘，沿共同竖直轴线相距6.0厘米放置，两圆盘带等量异种电荷，且电荷在盘面均匀分布。为使一个质量$4.0 × 10^{-15}$千克、电荷量$-e$的微小油滴悬浮在两圆盘轴线中点处，每个圆盘需带多少电荷量q？

**解答** 设上圆盘带正电、下圆盘带负电，则上圆盘对油滴的作用力为吸引力，下圆盘对油滴的作用力为排斥力。由于油滴位于两圆盘中点，两圆盘对油滴的作用力大小相等，均为式（25-17）中的$F_z$。为使油滴平衡，向上的净静电力$2F_z$需等于油滴的重力mg。联立两力相等的关系与式（25-17），可得：
$$q=\frac{m g}{\frac{4 e}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R^2} \left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}}\right)}$$

求解得$q=35$纳库。

罗伯特·A·密立根在1906年开始的一系列实验中，正是利用类似方法测量出电子电荷量（见第26-6节）。

#### 特殊情况：球对称电荷分布
在一种特殊情况下，连续电荷分布可视为点电荷，直接用点电荷形式的库仑定律计算——即电荷呈球对称分布。此时，体电荷密度可能随半径r变化，但在任意半径处的薄球壳内，电荷密度均匀。

首先考虑薄球壳。在第14-5节中，我们已得出均匀密度薄球壳对质点的万有引力具有两个特性：（1）壳内质点所受引力为零；（2）壳外质点所受引力，等效于将球壳全部质量集中于球心时的引力。

由于万有引力与静电力均遵循平方反比定律（均与$1/r^2$成正比），引力与静电力具有对称性，因此引力的许多结论可直接应用于静电力，无需额外推导证明。均匀带电球壳的静电力特性便是如此，其证明过程与第14-5节中万有引力特性的证明完全一致：

- 均匀带电薄球壳对壳内任意位置的点电荷，均不施加静电力。
- 均匀带电薄球壳对壳外点电荷的静电力，等效于将球壳全部电荷集中于球心时的静电力。

引力与静电力的唯一区别是：引力始终为吸引力，而静电力可为吸引力或排斥力。但这一区别不影响上述两个特性从引力到静电力的推广。

利用这些特性，可推导球对称电荷分布的相关结论：若电荷呈球对称分布（体电荷密度$\rho$为常量或仅随半径r变化），可将该球体视为由一系列薄球壳组成，每个薄球壳内电荷均匀分布（不同球壳的电荷密度可不同）。对每个薄球壳应用上述两个特性：
- 若检验电荷位于球内某位置，根据第一个特性，该位置外侧所有球壳对检验电荷的作用力均为零；
- 若检验电荷位于球外，根据第二个特性，每个球壳均可等效为球心处的点电荷，因此整个球体可等效为将总电荷集中于球心的点电荷（该结论在万有引力中的应用见例题14-4）。

正因如此，原子核对核外电子的作用力无法反映核内正电荷的分布情况：对于电荷密度仅随r变化的球对称原子核，无论核内电荷如何分布，对核外电子的作用力均相同。但电子偶尔会穿透原子核，此时便可通过作用力变化获取核内正电荷分布的信息。

#### 例题25-7
某原子的球形原子核半径为R，核内总正电荷为$Ze$。分别在以下两种核电荷分布情况下，比较电子在核内半径$0.5R$处与半径R处受到的作用力大小：（a）核内电荷密度均匀；（b）核内电荷密度与半径r成正比。

**（a）解答** 对于电荷均匀分布的原子核（大多数原子核的近似模型），其体电荷密度为：
$$
\rho=\frac{q}{V}=\frac{Ze}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
$$

当电子位于$r=R$（核表面）时，整个原子核可等效为集中于球心、电荷量$q=Ze$的点电荷，因此电子在$r=R$处受到的作用力为：
$$
F(R)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{R^2}
$$

当电子位于$r=R/2$时，根据薄球壳第一个特性，半径大于$R/2$的球壳对电子的作用力为零，仅需考虑半径小于$R/2$的球体内的电荷（等效为球心处的点电荷）。由于球体体积与$r^3$成正比，$r=R/2$以内的体积为整个核体积的$(1/2)^3=1/8$，因此该区域内的电荷为总电荷的1/8。由此可得：
$$
\frac{F(R/2)}{F(R)}=\frac{1}{8}
$$

**（b）解答** 设电荷密度$\rho(r)=br$（b为比例常数）。首先根据原子核总电荷$Ze$确定b的值：
$$
\int_{0}^{R} \rho dV=\int_{0}^{R}(br) 4\pi r^2 dr=Ze
$$
式中，$dV=4\pi r^2 dr$为薄球壳体积。计算积分得$b=Ze/(\pi R^4)$。

根据薄球壳第二个特性，电子在$r=R$处受到的作用力$F(R)$与电荷分布无关，故两种分布下$F(R)$相同。但电子在$r=R/2$处的作用力$F(R/2)$不同：需先计算$r=R/2$以内的电荷量$q'$（外侧电荷作用力为零）：
$$
q'=\int_{0}^{R/2} \rho dV=\int_{0}^{R/2} \frac{Ze r}{\pi R^4} 4\pi r^2 dr=\frac{Ze}{16}
$$

将$r=R/2$以内的电荷等效为球心处的点电荷$q'$，可得电子在该位置的作用力为表面作用力的1/16：
$$
\frac{F(R/2)}{F(R)}=\frac{1}{16}
$$

该结果与（a）中均匀电荷分布的情况差异显著，表明：核外电子无法区分不同的球对称电荷分布，但核内电子可通过作用力差异明确区分。

原子中的电子偶尔会穿透原子核，也可通过加速器将电子射入原子核。这两种方法均可用于获取核内电荷分布信息。实验结果表明：大多数原子核的电荷密度近乎均匀。尽管质子间的库仑排斥力会使质子倾向于向核表面移动，且质子间的强核力会使质子倾向于聚集在核中心，但原子核内质子的分布密度仍大致均匀，且轻核与重核的电荷密度近似相同。这些出人意料的结果为研究核力的重要特性提供了线索。


### 25-6 CONSERVATION OF CHARGE
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, a positive charge appears on the rod. Measurement shows that a corresponding negative charge appears on the silk. This suggests that rubbing does not create charge but merely transfers it from one object to another, disturbing slightly the electrical neutrality of each. This hypothesis of the conservation of charge has stood up under careful experimental tests both for large-scale objects and for atoms, nuclei, and elementary particles. No exceptions have ever been found.

In analogy with other conservation laws, such as conservation of momentum or conservation of energy, we can express conservation of electric charge as 
$$
\sum q = \text{constant or } q_i = q_f \quad (25-18)
$$

In any process occurring in an isolated system the net initial charge must equal the net final charge. In finding the net charge, it is important to take into account the signs of the individual charges.

An interesting example of charge conservation comes about when an electron (charge = -e) and an antielectron or positron (charge = +e) are brought close to each other. The two particles may annihilate one another, converting all their rest energy into radiant energy. The radiant energy may appear in the form of two gamma rays (high-energy packets of electromagnetic radiation, which are chargeless): 
$$
e^- + e^+ \to \gamma + \gamma
$$

The net charge is zero both before and after the event, and charge is conserved.

Certain uncharged particles, such as the neutral π meson, sometimes decay into two gamma rays: 
$$
\pi^0 \to \gamma + \gamma
$$

This decay conserves charge, the total charge again being 0 before and after the decay. For another example, a neutron (q=0) decays into a proton (q=+e) and an electron (q=-e) plus another neutral particle, a neutrino (q=0): 
$$
n \to p + e^- + \nu
$$

The total charge is zero, both before and after the decay, and charge is conserved. Experiments have been done to search for decays of the neutron into a proton with no electron emitted, which would violate charge conservation. No such events have been found.

The decay of an electron (q=-e) into neutral particles, such as gamma rays (γ) or neutrinos (ν), is forbidden; for example 
$$
e \to \gamma + \nu
$$
because that decay would violate charge conservation. Attempts to observe this decay have likewise been unsuccessful, indicating that, if the decay does occur, the electron must have a lifetime of at least $10^{23}$ years!

Another example of charge conservation is found in the fusion of two deuterium nuclei $^2H$ (called “heavy hydrogen”) to make helium. Among the possible reactions are 
$$
^2H + ^2H \to ^3H + p,
$$
$$
^2H + ^2H \to ^3He + n.
$$

The deuterium nucleus contains one proton and one neutron and therefore has a charge of +e. The nucleus of the isotope of hydrogen with mass 3, written $^3H$ and known as tritium, contains one proton and two neutrons, and thus also has a charge of +e. The first reaction therefore has a net charge of +2e on each side and conserves charge. In the second reaction, the neutron is uncharged, while the nucleus of the isotope of helium with mass 3 contains two protons and one neutron and therefore has a charge of +2e. The second reaction thus also conserves charge. Conservation of charge explains why we never see a proton emitted along with $^3He$ or a neutron along with $^3H$.

To sum up, charge is conserved in all known interactions among particles; no exceptions have ever been observed.

### 25-6 电荷守恒定律
当用丝绸摩擦玻璃棒时，玻璃棒会带上正电荷。测量发现，丝绸上会同时出现等量的负电荷。这一现象表明：摩擦并非创造电荷，而是将电荷从一个物体转移到另一个物体，仅轻微打破了两个物体原本的电中性。这种“电荷守恒”的假说，经过对宏观物体、原子、原子核及基本粒子的精密实验验证，至今未发现任何例外情况。

与动量守恒、能量守恒等其他守恒定律类似，电荷守恒定律可表示为：
$$
\sum q = \text{常量 或 } q_i = q_f \quad (25-18)
$$

在孤立系统中发生的任何过程，系统的初始净电荷必定等于最终净电荷。计算净电荷时，需特别注意各电荷的正负符号。

电荷守恒的一个典型例子是：当电子（电荷为-e）与正电子（电子的反粒子，电荷为+e）相互靠近时，两者可能发生湮灭，将自身全部静能转化为辐射能，辐射能常以两束伽马射线（高能电磁辐射光子，不带电）的形式存在，反应式为：
$$
e^- + e^+ \to \gamma + \gamma
$$

该过程前后的净电荷均为零，电荷守恒成立。

某些不带电粒子（如中性π介子）有时会衰变为两束伽马射线：
$$
\pi^0 \to \gamma + \gamma
$$

这种衰变过程同样遵循电荷守恒——衰变前后总电荷均为零。再如，中子（q=0）会衰变为质子（q=+e）、电子（q=-e）及另一种中性粒子（中微子，q=0），反应式为：
$$
n \to p + e^- + \nu
$$

衰变前后总电荷均为零，电荷守恒成立。科学家曾实验寻找“中子衰变为质子但不发射电子”的过程（该过程会违背电荷守恒），但从未观测到此类事件。

电子（q=-e）衰变为中性粒子（如伽马射线γ或中微子ν）的过程是被禁止的，例如反应：
$$
e \to \gamma + \nu
$$
因为该衰变会破坏电荷守恒。观测此类衰变的尝试均以失败告终，这表明：即使电子存在这种衰变，其寿命也至少长达$10^{23}$年（远超当前宇宙年龄）。

电荷守恒的另一个例子是氘核（$^2H$，即“重氢”原子核）的聚变反应——两个氘核聚变可形成氦核，可能的反应式如下：
$$
^2H + ^2H \to ^3H + p,
$$
$$
^2H + ^2H \to ^3He + n.
$$

氘核含1个质子和1个中子，电荷为+e；氢的同位素氚（$^3H$）的原子核含1个质子和2个中子，电荷也为+e。因此，第一个反应式两侧的净电荷均为+2e，电荷守恒成立。在第二个反应中，中子不带电，氦的同位素$^3He$的原子核含2个质子和1个中子，电荷为+2e，故反应式两侧净电荷同样为+2e，电荷守恒成立。正是电荷守恒定律，解释了为何从未观测到“伴随$^3He$发射质子”或“伴随$^3H$发射中子”的聚变过程。

综上，在所有已知的粒子相互作用过程中，电荷均守恒，从未发现例外。
