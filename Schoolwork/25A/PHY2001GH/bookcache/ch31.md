# DC CIRCUITS


### 31-1 ELECTRIC CURRENT（原文）
In Section 29-3, we discussed the flow of electric charge through conductors. The electric current $i$ is the net amount of charge per unit time passing through an element of surface area at any particular location in the conductor. More often, we are concerned with the total current passing through a circuit, in which case the area is the entire cross section of the wires that connect the parts of the circuit.

Figure 31-1 illustrates the general problem we analyze in this chapter. A battery is connected to a “device.” The device may be a single circuit element, such as a resistor or a capacitor, or it may be a combination of circuit elements. The battery maintains the upper terminal at a potential $V_{+}$ and the lower terminal at a potential $V_{-}$. For an ideal battery, the potential difference $V_{+}-V_{-}$ between its terminals is independent of the amount of current that it is providing to the circuit. As we discuss later in this chapter, for real batteries the potential difference does depend on the current.

In the electrostatic case, in which conductors are equipotentials, the potential $V_{+}$ at the positive terminal of the battery would characterize the entire wire connecting the upper end of the device to the battery. In this case, the potential difference $V_{+}-V_{-}$ between the battery terminals would also appear between the upper and lower terminals of the device. When currents are flowing in the wires, the conclusions of electrostatics are no longer valid; in particular, we know from our discussion in Section 29-4 (see Eq. 29-12) that when a current $i$ flows in a conductor there is a potential difference $\Delta V=i R$ across the conductor. However, the resistance of the wires is usually very small compared with the resistance of the device in our circuit, so we are usually justified in neglecting the effect of the wires; in particular, we assume that there is no potential drop in the wires, and in this case the full voltage difference of the battery terminals does appear across the terminals of the device.

The battery can be considered a “pump” for charge, as if it were bringing positive charge through the battery from the negative terminal to the positive one. In actuality, it is usually the motion of the negatively charged electrons that is responsible for the current flow. Another way of interpreting the flow of charge in the circuit is to regard the positive charge as “falling” through the device from a region of high potential (the part of the device connected to the positive terminal of the battery) to a region of lower potential (the part of the device connected to the negative terminal of the battery).

The function of the battery in the circuit is to maintain the potential difference that enables the flow of charge. The battery is not a source of electrons. Electrons pass through the battery and have their energy raised as they move inside the battery from the positive to the negative terminal. When we say that a battery is “drained,” we do not mean that it has “used up” its supply of electrons; instead, we mean that we have exhausted the source of energy (often a chemical reaction) that was responsible for raising the energies of the electrons. Note in Fig. 31-1 that the electrons move throughout the entire circuit; they do not “come from” the battery.

Although in metals the charge carriers are electrons, in electrolytes or in gaseous conductors (plasmas) they may also be positive or negative ions, or both. We need a convention for labeling the direction of current because charges of opposite sign move in opposite directions in a given field. A positive charge moving in one direction is equivalent in nearly all external effects to a negative charge moving in the opposite direction. Hence, for simplicity and algebraic consistency, we adopt the following convention:

The direction of current is the direction that positive charges would move, even if the actual charge carriers are negative.

If the charge carriers are negative, they simply move opposite to the direction of the current arrow (as in Fig. 31-1).

Under most circumstances, we analyze electric circuits based on an assumed direction for the current, without taking into account whether the actual charge carriers are positive or negative. In rare cases (see, for example, the Hall effect in Section 32-4) we must take into account the sign of the charge carriers.

#### Conservation of Charge
When we first connect the battery to the device, the circuit behaves in an irregular manner. The situation is similar to what occurs when you first turn on a garden hose connected to a sprinkler. At first the water gushes through the hose, creating whirlpools and eddies. When it reaches the sprinkler it may at first by chance emerge from some of the holes and not from others. After a few seconds a steady flow is established, and the water flows past any point at a constant rate. In electrical circuits, we usually ignore this initial behavior (called the transient behavior) and consider only the steady situation, which is reached very rapidly (within nanoseconds).

We assume that, under steady conditions, charge does not collect at or drain away from any point in our idealized wire. In the language of fluid flow, there are no sources or sinks of charge in the wire. When we made this assumption in our study of incompressible fluids, we concluded that the rate at which the fluid flows past any cross section of a pipe is the same even if the cross section varies. The fluid flows faster where the pipe is smaller and slower where it is larger, but the volume rate of flow, measured perhaps in liters/second, remains constant. In the same way, the electric current $i$ is the same for all cross sections of a conductor, even though the cross-sectional area may be different at different points. The current density $\vec{j}$ (current per unit area) will change as the cross-sectional area changes, but the current $i$ remains the same.

Figure 31-2a shows the circuit of Fig. 31-1 in simpler notation. The device is indicated merely by a box. Note that the current going into the device is the same as the current coming out of the device. This is an example of conservation of charge; no net charge is retained by the device—for every electron that enters at one end, one electron leaves the other end.

Figure 31-2b shows another circuit in which the current travels in succession through three devices, labeled A, B, and C. The current $i_{A}$ in device A is exactly equal to the current $i_{B}$ in device B and also to the current $i_{C}$ in device C; that is, $i_{A}=i_{B}=i_{C}$. No current is “used up” in traveling through any circuit element. Figure 31-2b is an example of circuit elements connected in series, in which the same current must travel in succession through each element of the circuit.

Figure 31-2c shows the current in a different combination of circuit elements. Here the current must divide when it reaches point $a$ in the circuit, with an amount $i_{A}$ passing through device A and an amount $i_{B}$ passing through device B. (The relative amounts in A and B, which are not important for this discussion, depend on the properties of A and B.) At point $b$ the currents must recombine. Because no charge gets trapped at point $a$, the current entering point $a$ must be exactly the same as the current leaving it, or $i=i_{A}+i_{B}$. Similarly, the current entering point $b$ must be the same as the current leaving point $b$, or $i_{A}+i_{B}=i$. This is often called the junction rule for analyzing circuits:

At any junction in an electric circuit, the total current entering the junction must be equal to the total current leaving the junction.

In this rule the term “junction” means a point in a circuit where several wire segments meet, such as points $a$ or $b$ in Fig. 31-2c. The junction rule (sometimes known as Kirchhoff’s first law) is really a statement about the conservation of electric charge.

Figure 31-2c is an example of a parallel connection of circuit elements. A characteristic of a parallel connection is that the current must divide to pass separately through individual elements and then recombine.

### 31-1 电流（中文翻译）
在29-3节中，我们讨论了电荷在导体中的流动。电流$i$是单位时间内通过导体中某一位置表面积元的净电荷量。更常见的是，我们关注通过电路的总电流，此时的面积指的是连接电路各部分的导线的整个横截面积。

图31-1展示了本章要分析的一般问题：一个电池与一个“器件”相连。该器件可以是单个电路元件（如电阻器或电容器），也可以是多个电路元件的组合。电池维持上端端子的电势为$V_{+}$，下端端子的电势为$V_{-}$。对于理想电池，其端子间的电势差$V_{+}-V_{-}$与它向电路提供的电流大小无关。本章后续将讨论，实际电池的电势差则与电流相关。

在静电情况下，导体为等势体，电池正极的电势$V_{+}$会表征连接器件上端与电池的整个导线。此时，电池端子间的电势差$V_{+}-V_{-}$也会出现在器件的上下端子之间。当导线中有电流流动时，静电学的结论不再成立；具体来说，由29-4节的讨论（见式29-12）可知，当电流$i$在导体中流动时，导体两端会产生电势差$\Delta V=i R$。然而，导线的电阻通常远小于电路中器件的电阻，因此我们通常有理由忽略导线的影响——特别是假设导线中没有电势降，此时电池端子的全部电压差会完全施加在器件的端子上。

电池可被视为电荷的“泵”，仿佛能将正电荷从负极通过电池内部输送到正极。但实际上，电流的形成通常是由带负电的电子运动引起的。另一种理解电路中电荷流动的方式是：正电荷从高电势区域（器件中与电池正极相连的部分）“下落”到低电势区域（器件中与电池负极相连的部分）。

电池在电路中的作用是维持能使电荷流动的电势差。电池并非电子的来源，电子会穿过电池，且在电池内部从正极向负极移动时能量会升高。当我们说电池“耗尽”时，并非指它用完了电子供应，而是指用于提升电子能量的能量源（通常是化学反应）已耗尽。注意图31-1中，电子在整个电路中循环移动，并非“来自”电池。

尽管金属中的载流子是电子，但在电解质或气体导体（等离子体）中，载流子也可能是正离子、负离子，或两者兼具。由于异种电荷在同一电场中运动方向相反，我们需要一个电流方向的约定。正电荷沿某一方向的运动，在几乎所有外部效应上都等同于负电荷沿相反方向的运动。因此，为简化分析并保证代数一致性，我们采用以下约定：

电流的方向是正电荷会移动的方向，即使实际载流子是负的。

若载流子为负，则它们的运动方向与电流箭头方向相反（如图31-1所示）。

大多数情况下，我们分析电路时会假设一个电流方向，无需考虑实际载流子的正负。仅在极少数情况下（例如32-4节的霍尔效应），才需要考虑载流子的符号。

#### 电荷守恒
当首次将电池与器件连接时，电路会表现出不规则行为，这与首次打开连接洒水器的水管时的情况类似：起初水会涌入水管，形成漩涡和涡流，到达洒水器时可能随机从部分孔洞喷出而非全部；几秒后会建立稳定流动，水以恒定速率流过任意点。在电路中，我们通常忽略这种初始行为（称为暂态行为），只考虑稳态情况——稳态会在极短时间内（纳秒级）建立。

我们假设在稳态条件下，理想导线中任何点都不会积累或流失电荷。用流体力学的语言来说，导线中没有电荷的源或汇。在研究不可压缩流体时，我们曾得出结论：即使管道横截面积变化，流体通过任意横截面的速率也保持不变——管道较细处流体流速较快，较粗处流速较慢，但体积流量（单位通常为升/秒）恒定。同理，导体中所有横截面的电流$i$都相同，即便不同位置的横截面积可能不同。电流密度$\vec{j}$（单位面积的电流）会随横截面积变化，但电流$i$保持不变。

图31-2a以简化符号展示了图31-1的电路，器件仅用一个方框表示。注意流入器件的电流与流出器件的电流相等，这是电荷守恒的体现——器件不会保留净电荷，每有一个电子从一端流入，就有一个电子从另一端流出。

图31-2b展示了另一个电路，电流依次通过三个标记为A、B、C的器件。器件A中的电流$i_{A}$与器件B中的$i_{B}$、器件C中的$i_{C}$完全相等，即$i_{A}=i_{B}=i_{C}$。电流在通过任何电路元件时都不会“被消耗掉”。图31-2b是元件串联的示例，串联电路中电流必须依次通过每个元件。

图31-2c展示了不同的元件组合方式：电流到达电路中的$a$点时必须分流，一部分电流$i_{A}$通过器件A，另一部分$i_{B}$通过器件B（A、B中电流的相对大小取决于两者的特性，本讨论中无需关注）；在$b$点，两部分电流重新汇合。由于$a$点不会积累电荷，流入$a$点的总电流必须等于流出的总电流，即$i=i_{A}+i_{B}$；同理，流入$b$点的总电流等于流出的总电流，即$i_{A}+i_{B}=i$。这一规律常被称为电路分析的节点定则：

在电路的任何节点处，流入节点的总电流等于流出节点的总电流。

该定则中，“节点”指电路中多条导线交汇的点（如图31-2c中的$a$点或$b$点）。节点定则（有时也称为基尔霍夫第一定律）本质上是电荷守恒定律的体现。

图31-2c是元件并联的示例，并联电路的特点是电流必须分流通过各个元件，之后再重新汇合。


### 31-2 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE（原文）
An external energy source is required by most electrical circuits to move charge through the circuit. The circuit therefore must include a device that maintains a potential difference between two points in the circuit, just as a circulating fluid requires an analogous device (a pump) that maintains a pressure difference between two points.

Any device that performs this task in an electrical circuit is called a source (or a seat) of electromotive force (symbol $\mathscr{E}$; abbreviation emf, which is pronounced “ee-em-eff”). It is sometimes useful to consider a source of emf as a mechanism that creates a “hill” of potential and moves charge “uphill,” from which the charge flows “downhill” through the rest of the circuit. A common source of emf is the ordinary battery; another is the electric generator found in power plants. Solar cells are sources of emf used both in spacecraft and in pocket calculators. Other less commonly found sources of emf are fuel cells (used to power the space shuttle) and thermopiles. Biological systems, including the human heart, also function as sources of emf.

Figure 31-3a shows a source of emf connected to an electronic device, which might be a resistor, capacitor, or other circuit element. The emf is represented in the circuit by an arrow that is placed next to the source and points in the direction in which the emf, acting alone, would cause a positive charge carrier to move in the external circuit. We draw a small circle on the tail of the emf arrow so that it will not be mistaken for a current arrow. In the external circuit, positive charge carriers would be driven in the direction shown by the current arrows marked $i$. In other words, the source of emf sets up a clockwise current in the circuit of Fig. 31-3a.

The most common source of emf that we will use is the ordinary battery. As shown in Fig. 31-3a, a battery is represented in a circuit by two parallel lines of different length. The longer line always indicates the positive terminal of the battery. The source of emf (the battery) maintains its upper terminal at a high potential $V_{+}$ and its lower terminal at a low potential $V_{-}$. Common batteries (size AAA, AA, C, or D) that we use for flashlights or portable CD players have an emf of 1.5 volts. As we will see in the next section, the battery emf is equal to the terminal potential difference $V_{+}-V_{-}$ only if there is no current in the circuit or if the battery has a negligible internal resistance.

A source of emf must be able to do work on charge carriers that enter it. The source acts to move positive charges from a point of low potential (the negative terminal) through its interior to a point of high potential (the positive terminal). The charges then move through the external circuit, in the process dissipating the energy provided to them by the source of emf. Eventually, they return to the negative terminal, from which the emf raises them to the positive terminal again, and the cycle continues. (Note that, in accordance with the usual convention, we analyze the circuit as if positive charge were flowing. The actual motion of the electrons is in the opposite direction.)

When a steady current has been established in the circuit of Fig. 31-3a, a charge $dq$ passes through any cross section of the circuit in time $dt$. In particular, this charge enters the source of emf $\mathscr{E}$ at its low-potential end and leaves at its high-potential end. The source must do an amount of work $dW$ on the (positive) charge carriers to force them to go to the point of higher potential. The emf $\mathscr{E}$ of the source is defined as the work per unit charge, or 
$$
\mathscr{E} = \frac{dW}{dq} \quad (31-1)
$$

The unit of emf is the joule/coulomb, which is the same as the volt. Note from Eq. 31-1 that the electromotive force is not actually a force; that is, we do not measure it in newtons. The name originates from the early history of the subject.

The source of emf provides energy to the circuit. Its energy might be obtained from a variety of processes: chemical (as in a battery or a fuel cell), mechanical (a generator), thermal (a thermopile), or radiant (a solar cell). The current in the circuit of Fig. 31-3a transfers energy from the source of emf to the device D. If the device is another battery that is being charged by the source of emf, then the energy transferred appears as chemical energy newly stored in the battery. If the device is a resistor, the transferred energy appears as internal energy (observed perhaps as an increase in temperature) and can then be transferred to the environment as heat. If the device is a capacitor, the energy transferred is stored as potential energy in its electric field. In each of these cases, conservation of energy requires that the amount of energy lost by the battery must equal the amount of energy transferred to, dissipated by, or stored in the device D.

Figure 31-3b shows a gravitational analogue of Fig. 31-3a. In the lower figure the person, in lifting the bowling balls from the floor to the shelf, does work on them. The balls roll slowly and uniformly along the shelf, dropping from the right end into a cylinder full of viscous oil. They sink to the bottom at an essentially constant speed, are removed by a trapdoor mechanism not shown, and roll back along the floor to the left. The energy put into the system by the person appears eventually as internal energy in the viscous fluid, resulting in a temperature rise. The energy supplied by the person comes from her store of internal (chemical) energy. The circulation of charges in Fig. 31-3a stops eventually if the source of emf runs out of energy; the circulation of bowling balls in Fig. 31-3b stops eventually if the person runs out of energy.

Figure 31-4a shows a circuit containing two sources of emf (batteries) A and B, a device D, and an ideal electric motor M employed in lifting a weight. The batteries are connected so that they tend to send charges around the circuit in opposite directions; the actual direction of the current is determined by battery B, which has the larger emf. Figure 31-4b shows the energy transfers in this circuit. The chemical energy in battery B is steadily depleted, the energy appearing in the three forms shown on the right. Battery A is being charged while battery B is being discharged.

Note that the circuit can transfer energy from a source of emf or into a source of emf. In the ideal case, the energy transfer process associated with a source of emf is reversible in the thermodynamic sense (see Section 24-1). A battery can either be charged (meaning an external source adds to the battery’s supply of energy, not that we are forcing more charge into the battery) or discharged (meaning we take energy from the battery). Similarly, a generator can be driven mechanically to produce electrical energy, or it can use electrical energy to produce mechanical motion, as in a motor.

### 31-2 电动势（中文翻译）
大多数电路需要外部能源来推动电荷在电路中流动。因此，电路中必须包含一个能维持电路两点间电势差的器件——这与循环流动的流体需要类似器件（泵）维持两点间压强差的原理相同。

在电路中实现这一功能的任何器件，都被称为电动势源（符号为$\mathscr{E}$，缩写为emf，发音为“ee-em-eff”）。有时可以将电动势源理解为一种“构建”电势“山丘”的机制：它将电荷“推上”电势山，之后电荷再从山上“滑下”，流过电路的其他部分。常见的电动势源包括普通电池；发电厂中的发电机也属于电动势源；太阳能电池作为电动势源，既用于航天器，也用于便携式计算器；其他较不常见的电动势源有燃料电池（用于为航天飞机供能）和温差电堆。包括人类心脏在内的生物系统，也可作为电动势源发挥作用。

图31-3a展示了一个电动势源与电子器件（可能是电阻器、电容器或其他电路元件）相连的情况。电路中，电动势用一条靠近电源的箭头表示，箭头方向为：仅在电动势作用下，正载流子在外部电路中会移动的方向。为避免与电流箭头混淆，我们在电动势箭头的尾部画一个小圆圈。在外部电路中，正载流子会沿标记为$i$的电流箭头方向运动。换句话说，该电动势源在图31-3a的电路中建立了顺时针方向的电流。

我们最常用的电动势源是普通电池。如图31-3a所示，电路中电池用两条长度不同的平行线表示，较长的线始终代表电池的正极。电动势源（电池）维持其上端子为高电势$V_{+}$，下端子为低电势$V_{-}$。我们用于手电筒或便携式CD播放器的普通电池（AAA、AA、C或D型），其电动势均为1.5伏。下一节将介绍，只有当电路中无电流，或电池的内阻可忽略时，电池的电动势才等于其端子间的电势差$V_{+}-V_{-}$。

电动势源必须能对进入其中的载流子做功：它将正电荷从低电势点（负极）通过其内部转移到高电势点（正极）。随后，这些电荷流过外部电路，在此过程中消耗电动势源提供给它们的能量，最终回到负极；之后电动势源再次将它们“提升”到正极，循环往复。（请注意，按照常规约定，我们分析电路时假设正电荷在流动，而电子的实际运动方向与此相反。）

当图31-3a的电路中建立起稳恒电流后，在时间$dt$内，电荷量$dq$会通过电路的任意横截面。具体来说，这些电荷从电动势源$\mathscr{E}$的低电势端进入，从高电势端流出。为迫使（正）载流子到达高电势点，电动势源必须对其做功$dW$。电动势源的电动势$\mathscr{E}$定义为单位电荷所做的功，即：
$$
\mathscr{E} = \frac{dW}{dq} \quad (31-1)
$$

电动势的单位是焦耳/库仑，与伏特的单位相同。由式31-1可知，电动势并非真正的“力”（即不用牛顿作为计量单位），这一名称源于该学科的早期发展历史。

电动势源为电路提供能量，其能量可来自多种过程：化学过程（如电池或燃料电池）、机械过程（如发电机）、热过程（如温差电堆）或辐射过程（如太阳能电池）。图31-3a电路中的电流将能量从电动势源传递到器件D：若器件D是另一个被该电动势源充电的电池，传递的能量会以新储存的化学能形式存在于电池中；若器件D是电阻器，传递的能量会转化为内能（通常表现为温度升高），随后可能以热量形式传递到环境中；若器件D是电容器，传递的能量会以电场势能的形式储存在电容器中。在所有这些情况下，根据能量守恒定律，电池损失的能量必须等于传递给器件D、被器件D消耗或储存在器件D中的能量。

图31-3b展示了图31-3a的重力类比模型：图中人物将保龄球从地面举到架子上，对球做功；保龄球沿架子缓慢匀速滚动，从右端落入装满粘性油的圆柱形容器中，以基本恒定的速度下沉到底部，随后通过未画出的活门机构被移出，并沿地面滚回左侧。人物输入系统的能量最终转化为粘性流体的内能，导致流体温度升高，而人物提供的能量来自其自身储存的化学能。若图31-3a中电动势源的能量耗尽，电荷的循环会最终停止；同理，若图31-3b中的人物能量耗尽，保龄球的循环也会最终停止。

图31-4a展示了一个包含两个电动势源（电池A和B）、一个器件D以及一个用于提升重物的理想电动机M的电路。两个电池的连接方式使其倾向于推动电荷沿相反方向在电路中流动，电流的实际方向由电动势更大的电池B决定。图31-4b展示了该电路中的能量转移：电池B中的化学能不断消耗，转化为右侧所示的三种能量形式；同时，电池A处于充电状态，而电池B处于放电状态。

需注意，电路既可以将能量从电动势源向外传递，也可以向电动势源内部传递。在理想情况下，与电动势源相关的能量转移过程在热力学意义上是可逆的（见24-1节）。电池既可以充电（指外部能源为电池补充能量，而非强行向电池中注入更多电荷），也可以放电（指从电池中获取能量）；类似地，发电机既可以通过机械驱动产生电能，也可以利用电能产生机械运动（如作为电动机使用）。


### 31-3 ANALYSIS OF CIRCUITS（原文）
The simplest electrical circuit consists of one source of emf (such as a battery) and one circuit device (such as a resistor). Examples of this kind of circuit might include a flashlight or an electric heater. Figure 31-5 shows a circuit consisting of a single ideal battery and a resistor $R$. The symbolic circuit notation for a resistor is $-W-$.

Often our goal in analyzing circuits is to determine the magnitude and direction of the current, given the emfs and resistors in the circuit. We will analyze this circuit by considering the potential differences across each circuit element. Later in this chapter we consider another method based on the energy supplied or dissipated by each circuit element.

The first step in analyzing the circuit is to guess a direction for the current. Usually we try to make the best guess we can; if we choose the wrong direction the current will come out to be negative, indicating that our original guess for the direction was wrong, but the magnitude we calculate will still be correct. In the circuit of Fig. 31-5, we expect that the current is clockwise, determined by the emf of the battery. The battery maintains point $a$ at a higher potential than point $b$ and so positive charges in the circuit would “fall” through the resistor from $a$ to $b$ before returning to the battery to be pumped back up to the higher potential of $a$.

When we analyze the circuit using the method of potential differences, we travel once around the loop and keep track of the differences in potential across each circuit element. It does not matter which way we travel around the loop in making this analysis. Let us try going around clockwise (in the same direction as the current), starting at point $a$.

Let $\Delta V_{R}$ be the potential difference across the resistor. That is, the potential at $a$ is greater than the potential at $b$ by an amount $\Delta V_{R}$, which is equal to $i R$. How do we know that $V_{a}$ is greater than $V_{b}$? We do not yet know this for certain, but it is consistent with the direction we have guessed for the current through $R$. If the current flows from $a$ to $b$, then the positive charge carriers are “falling” through the resistor from the higher potential at $a$ to the lower potential at $b$; if our initial guess for the direction of the current is wrong, our solution will show that both $i$ and $\Delta V_{R}$ are negative.

We are now ready to analyze the circuit. Our procedure is to start at any point, travel once around the circuit adding all the potential differences, and then return to the starting point where we must find the same potential at which we started. This procedure can be summarized as follows:

The algebraic sum of all differences in potential around a complete circuit loop must be zero.

This rule is known as the loop rule (and is sometimes referred to as Kirchhoff’s second law). Ultimately it is a statement about the conservation of energy. An analogy would be taking a walk in a hilly terrain; you may travel up or down as you walk, but if you keep track of all your changes in gravitational potential energy you will find that the total change is zero when you return to your starting point.

We now examine the changes in potential as we go once around the circuit of Fig. 31-5, starting at point $a$ where the potential is $V_{a}$. Proceeding clockwise from $a$ through the resistor, the potential drops by $\Delta V_{R}=i R$, so the potential at $b$ is $V_{b}=V_{a}-i R$. Continuing clockwise around the circuit, we next travel through the battery from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, and thus the potential increases by the battery emf $\mathscr{E}$. This now brings us back to point $a$ and the potential $V_{a}$. Since the starting and ending potentials at point $a$ must be equal (potential being a path-independent quantity), we therefore have $V_{a}=V_{a}-i R+\mathscr{E}$. Equivalently, we can find this result by applying the loop rule directly, adding up the differences in potential, and setting the resulting sum equal to zero. Again starting at $a$ and proceeding clockwise, we first encounter a negative potential difference of $-i R$ and then a positive potential difference of $+\mathscr{E}$. Setting the sum of these potential differences to zero, we obtain 
$$
-i R+\mathscr{E}=0
$$
Or 
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} \quad (31-2)
$$

We have now found the current in this circuit, which completes our analysis.

Let us now consider a slightly more complicated single-loop circuit, shown in Fig. 31-6. This circuit has a single battery but two resistors. We can once again guess that the current is clockwise. Let us travel around the circuit in a counterclockwise direction this time. Starting at point $a$ we first go through the battery and find a potential difference of $-\mathscr{E}$. Next we go through $R_{2}$ in a direction opposite to the current, so the potential increases and the potential difference is $+i R_{2}$. Similarly, the potential difference when we go through $R_{1}$ is $+i R_{1}$, after which we are back at our starting point. According to the loop rule, the total of these potential differences is zero: 
$$
-\mathscr{E}+i R_{2}+i R_{1}=0
$$
or 
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-3)
$$

Note that Eq. 31-3 reduces to Eq. 31-2 if either $R_{1}=0$ or $R_{2}=0$.

#### Potential Differences in a Circuit
We often want to find the potential difference between two points in a circuit. In Fig. 31-6, for example, how does the potential difference $\Delta V_{ab}(=V_{a}-V_{b})$ between points $a$ and $b$ depend on the circuit elements $\mathscr{E}$, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$? To find their relationship, let us start at point $b$ and move counterclockwise to point $a$ passing through resistor $R_{1}$. If $V_{a}$ and $V_{b}$ are the potentials at $a$ and $b$ respectively, we have 
$$
V_{b}+i R_{1}=V_{a}
$$
because we experience an increase in potential in traveling through a resistor in the direction opposite to the current. We rewrite this relation in terms of $\Delta V_{ab}$, the potential difference between $a$ and $b$, as 
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=+i R_{1}
$$
which tells us that $\Delta V_{ab}$ has magnitude $i R_{1}$ and that point $a$ is at a higher potential than point $b$. Combining this last equation with Eq. 31-3 yields 
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-4)
$$

In summary, to find the potential difference between any two points in a circuit, start at one point, travel through the circuit to the other, and add algebraically the changes in potential encountered. This algebraic sum is the potential difference between the points. This procedure is similar to that for finding the current in a closed loop, except that here the potential differences are added over part of a loop and not over the whole loop.

You can travel any path through the circuit between the two points, and you get the same value of the potential difference, because path independence is an essential part of our concept of potential. The potential difference between any two points can have only one value; we must obtain the same result for all paths that connect those points. (Similarly, if we consider two points on the side of a hill, the measured difference in gravitational potential between them is the same no matter what path is followed in going from one to the other.) In Fig. 31-6 let us recalculate $\Delta V_{ab}$, using a path starting at $a$ and going counterclockwise through the source of emf to $b$. We have 
$$
V_{a}-\mathscr{E}+i R_{2}=V_{b}
$$
Or 
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=+\mathscr{E}-i R_{2}
$$

Combining this result with Eq. 31-3 leads to Eq. 31-4.

Using similar methods, we can show that 
$$
\Delta V_{bc}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-5)
$$

Note that, as we should expect, $\Delta V_{ab}+\Delta V_{bc}=\mathscr{E}$. The combination of resistors in the circuit of Fig. 31-6 is called a voltage divider. In effect, it divides the voltage difference of the battery into two pieces in proportion to the sizes of the two resistors.

Another way of illustrating the potential differences in this circuit is shown in Fig. 31-7. For convenience we have started at point $c$ and traveled clockwise around the circuit. Here you can clearly see how the battery emf is “divided” into the potential differences across the two resistors.

#### Internal Resistance of a Source of EMF
In contrast to the ideal batteries we have been considering so far, real batteries have an internal resistance. This resistance is characteristic of the materials of which the battery is made. Because it is an inherent part of the battery, it cannot be removed; we would usually like to do so, for internal resistance has undesirable effects such as reducing the terminal voltage of the battery and limiting the current that can flow in the circuit.

Figure 31-8 shows the simple loop circuit of Fig. 31-5 with the internal resistance $r$ of the battery taken into account. Even though they are part of the same device, we show the source of emf and the internal resistance as separate elements.

The circuit of Fig. 31-8 is identical to the circuit of Fig. 31-6, and we can find the current by merely adapting Eq. 31-3 to the circuit elements of Fig. 31-8: 
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R+r} \quad (31-6)
$$

The internal resistance reduces the current that the emf can supply to the external circuit.

The potential difference between the battery terminals is $\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=\mathscr{E}-i r$; using Eq. 31-6 we obtain 
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R}{R+r} \quad (31-7)
$$

From this expression we see that the potential difference between the battery terminals is not a constant, but now depends on the resistance $R$ of the external circuit. As we make $R$ smaller, thereby increasing the current, the potential difference between the battery terminals decreases. A 1.5-V battery has a terminal voltage difference of 1.5 V only when there is no current flowing through the battery. When the battery is connected to a circuit device such as a radio, the voltage difference between the terminals will be less than 1.5 V.

We see from Eq. 31-7 that $\Delta V_{ab}$ is equal to $\mathscr{E}$ only if either the battery has no internal resistance ($r=0$) or the external circuit is open ($R=\infty$).

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-1
What is the current in the circuit of Fig. 31-9a? The emfs and the resistors have the following values: $\mathscr{E}_{1}=2.1 ~V$, $\mathscr{E}_{2}=4.4 ~V$, $r_{1}=1.8 \Omega$, $r_{2}=2.3 \Omega$, $R=5.5 \Omega$.

Solution: The two emfs are connected so that they oppose each other, but $\mathscr{E}_{2}$, because it is larger than $\mathscr{E}_{1}$, controls the direction of the current in the circuit, which is counterclockwise. The loop rule, applied clockwise from point $a$, yields 
$$
-\mathscr{E}_{2}+i r_{2}+i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=0
$$

Check that this same equation results by going around counterclockwise or by starting at some point other than $a$. Also, compare this equation term by term with Fig. 31-9b, which shows the potential changes graphically.

Solving for the current $i$ we obtain 
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{R+r_{1}+r_{2}}=\frac{4.4 ~V-2.1 ~V}{5.5 ~\Omega+1.8 ~\Omega+2.3 ~\Omega}=0.24 ~A
$$

It is not necessary to know the direction of the current in advance. To show this, let us assume that the current in Fig. 31-9a is clockwise—that is, opposite to the direction of the current arrow in Fig. 31-9a. The loop rule would then yield (going clockwise from $a$) 
$$
-\mathscr{E}_{2}-i r_{2}-i R-i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=0
$$
or 
$$
i=-\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{R+r_{1}+r_{2}}
$$

Substituting numerical values yields $i=-0.24 ~A$ for the current. The negative sign is a signal that the current is in the opposite direction from that which we have assumed.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-2
(a) What is the potential difference between points $a$ and $b$ in Fig. 31-9a? (b) What is the potential difference between points $a$ and $c$ in Fig. 31-9a?

Solution (a): This potential difference is the terminal potential difference of battery 2, which includes emf $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ and internal resistance $r_{2}$. Let us start at point $b$ and traverse the circuit counterclockwise to point $a$ passing directly through the source of emf. We find 
$$
V_{b}-i r_{2}+\mathscr{E}_{2}=V_{a}
$$
or 
$$
V_{a}-V_{b}=-i r_{2}+\mathscr{E}_{2}=-(0.24 ~A)(2.3 ~\Omega)+4.4 ~V=+3.8 ~V
$$

We see that $a$ is more positive than $b$ and the potential difference between them (3.8 V) is smaller than the emf (4.4 V); see Fig. 31-9b.

We can verify this result by starting at point $b$ in Fig. 31-9a and moving through the circuit clockwise to point $a$. For this different path we find 
$$
V_{b}+i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=V_{a}
$$
Or
$$
\begin{aligned} 
V_{a}-V_{b} & =i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1} \\ 
& =(0.24 ~A)(5.5 ~\Omega+1.8 ~\Omega)+2.1 ~V=+3.8 ~V, 
\end{aligned}
$$
exactly as before. The potential difference between two points has the same value for all paths connecting those points.

(b) Note that the potential difference between $a$ and $c$ is the terminal potential difference of battery 1, consisting of emf $\mathscr{E}_{1}$ and internal resistance $r_{1}$. Let us start at $c$ and traverse the circuit clockwise to point $a$. We find 
$$
V_{c}+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=V_{a}
$$
or 
$$
V_{a}-V_{c}=i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=(0.24 ~A)(1.8 ~\Omega)+2.1 ~V=+2.5 ~V
$$

This tells us that $a$ is at a higher potential than $c$. The terminal potential difference (2.5 V) is in this case larger than the emf (2.1 V); see Fig. 31-9b. Charge is being forced through $\mathscr{E}_{1}$ in a direction opposite to that in which it would send charge if it were acting by itself; if $\mathscr{E}_{1}$ were a storage battery it would be charging at the expense of $\mathscr{E}_{2}$, which is being discharged.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-3
Figure 31-10 shows a circuit with two loops. Find the currents in the circuit. The elements have the following values: $\mathscr{E}_{1}=2.1 ~V$, $\mathscr{E}_{2}=6.3 ~V$, $R_{1}=1.7 ~\Omega$, $R_{2}=3.5 ~\Omega$.

Solution: The first step in analyzing this circuit is to define currents and their directions in each branch. We have drawn currents $i_{1}$, $i_{2}$, and $i_{3}$ in the three branches and arbitrarily selected their directions. At point $a$ current $i_{3}$ flows in and currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ flow out. Applying the junction rule (Section 31-1), we have 
$$
i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}
$$

We now apply the loop rule to each of the two loops. Starting at $a$ and going counterclockwise around the left-hand loop, we find 
$$
-i_{1} R_{1}-\mathscr{E}_{1}-i_{1} R_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{2} R_{2}=0
$$
or
$$
2 i_{1} R_{1}-i_{2} R_{2}=\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}
$$

If we traverse the right-hand loop in a clockwise direction from point $a$, we find 
$$
+i_{3} R_{1}-\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{3} R_{1}+i_{2} R_{2}=0
$$
or, after substituting $i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}$ from the junction rule, 
$$
2 i_{1} R_{1}+\left(2 R_{1}+R_{2}\right) i_{2}=0
$$

We now have two equations for the two currents $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$. We can solve these equations for these variables, obtaining, after a little algebra, 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
i_{1} & =\frac{\left(\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}\right)\left(2 R_{1}+R_{2}\right)}{4 R_{1}\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)} \\ 
& =\frac{(6.3 ~V-2.1 ~V)(2 \times 1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}{(4)(1.7 ~\Omega)(1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}=0.82 ~A, 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned} 
i_{2} & =-\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{2\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)} \\ 
& =-\frac{6.3 ~V-2.1 ~V}{(2)(1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}=-0.40 ~A 
\end{aligned}
$$

The third current can be found from applying the junction rule: 
$$
i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}=0.82 ~A+(-0.40 ~A)=0.42 ~A
$$

The signs of the currents tell us that we have guessed correctly about the directions of $i_{1}$ and $i_{3}$, but that we are wrong about the direction of $i_{2}$; it should point up—and not down—in the central branch of the circuit of Fig. 31-10.

Note that, having discovered that current $i_{2}$ is pointing in the wrong direction, we do not need to change it in Fig. 31-10. We can leave it in the figure as it is, as long as we remember to substitute a negative numerical value for $i_{2}$ in all subsequent calculations involving that current.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-4
What is the potential difference between points $a$ and $b$ in the circuit of Fig. 31-10?

Solution: For the potential difference between $a$ and $b$ we have, moving through branch $ab$ in Fig. 31-10 and assuming the current directions shown, 
$$
V_{a}-i_{2} R_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{2}=V_{b}
$$
or 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
V_{a}-V_{b} & =\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{2} R_{2} \\ 
& =6.3 ~V+(-0.40 ~A)(3.5 ~\Omega)=+4.9 ~V 
\end{aligned}
$$

The positive sign tells us that $a$ is more positive in potential than $b$. We should expect this result from looking at the circuit diagram, because all three batteries have their positive terminals on the top side of the figure.


### 31-3 电路分析（中文翻译）
最简单的电路由一个电动势源（如电池）和一个电路器件（如电阻器）组成，手电筒、电暖器等都属于这类电路的例子。图31-5展示了一个由单个理想电池和一个电阻器$R$组成的电路，电阻器的电路符号为$-W-$。

通常，电路分析的目标是在已知电动势和电阻的情况下，确定电流的大小和方向。我们将通过分析每个电路元件两端的电势差来研究该电路；本章后续还会介绍另一种分析方法，该方法基于每个电路元件的能量供给或消耗规律。

电路分析的第一步是假设电流方向。通常我们会尽可能做出合理假设：若假设方向错误，计算得到的电流会为负值，这表明初始假设的方向不正确，但电流的大小仍然准确。在图31-5的电路中，受电池电动势影响，我们可推测电流方向为顺时针：电池维持$a$点电势高于$b$点，因此电路中的正电荷会从$a$点“下落”通过电阻器到达$b$点，之后回到电池，再被“泵回”$a$点的高电势处。

采用电势差法分析电路时，需沿回路绕行一周，记录每个电路元件两端的电势差，最终回到起点——此时起点的电势应与初始电势相同。该分析过程可总结为：

**闭合电路回路中，所有电势差的代数和为零。**

这一规律被称为“回路定则”（有时也称为基尔霍夫第二定律），本质上是能量守恒定律的体现。可通过一个类比理解：在丘陵地带行走时，你可能上坡也可能下坡，但只要记录所有重力势能的变化，最终回到起点时，总势能变化量一定为零。

现在，我们从电势为$V_{a}$的$a$点出发，沿图31-5的电路绕行一周，分析电势变化：沿顺时针方向经过电阻器时，电势降低$\Delta V_{R}=i R$，因此$b$点的电势为$V_{b}=V_{a}-i R$；继续顺时针绕行，接下来从电池负极到正极，电势会升高电池的电动势$\mathscr{E}$，最终回到$a$点，电势仍为$V_{a}$。由于电势是与路径无关的物理量，起点和终点（均为$a$点）的电势必须相等，因此有$V_{a}=V_{a}-i R+\mathscr{E}$。

也可直接应用回路定则推导该结果：将所有电势差代数相加并令其等于零。同样从$a$点顺时针出发，首先遇到的电势差为$-i R$（负值），随后遇到的电势差为$+\mathscr{E}$（正值），令两者之和为零，可得：
$$
-i R+\mathscr{E}=0
$$
即：
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} \quad (31-2)
$$

至此，我们已求出该电路的电流，完成了电路分析。

接下来考虑一个稍复杂的单回路电路（图31-6），该电路包含一个电池和两个电阻器。我们仍可假设电流方向为顺时针，此次选择沿逆时针方向绕行回路：从$a$点出发，首先经过电池，电势差为$-\mathscr{E}$（负值）；接着逆着电流方向经过$R_{2}$，电势升高，电势差为$+i R_{2}$（正值）；同理，经过$R_{1}$的电势差为$+i R_{1}$（正值），最终回到起点。根据回路定则，所有电势差的代数和为零：
$$
-\mathscr{E}+i R_{2}+i R_{1}=0
$$
即：
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-3)
$$

需注意，若$R_{1}=0$或$R_{2}=0$，式31-3会简化为式31-2。

#### 电路中的电势差
我们经常需要计算电路中两点之间的电势差。例如在图31-6中，$a$、$b$两点间的电势差$\Delta V_{ab}(=V_{a}-V_{b})$如何依赖于电路元件$\mathscr{E}$、$R_{1}$和$R_{2}$？为找到它们的关系，我们从$b$点出发，逆着电流方向经过电阻器$R_{1}$到达$a$点。设$a$、$b$两点的电势分别为$V_{a}$和$V_{b}$，则有：
$$
V_{b}+i R_{1}=V_{a}
$$
这是因为逆着电流方向通过电阻器时，电势会升高。将上式改写为$a$、$b$两点间电势差$\Delta V_{ab}$的表达式：
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=+i R_{1}
$$
该式表明，$\Delta V_{ab}$的大小为$i R_{1}$，且$a$点电势高于$b$点。将此式与式31-3结合，可得：
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-4)
$$

综上，计算电路中任意两点间的电势差时，可从其中一点出发，沿电路路径到达另一点，将途中遇到的所有电势变化代数相加，结果即为两点间的电势差。该过程与计算闭合回路电流的过程类似，区别在于前者只需对回路的一部分进行电势差求和，而非整个回路。

由于电势的核心特性是“与路径无关”，因此无论选择哪条路径连接两点，计算得到的电势差都相同——两点间的电势差只有一个确定值，所有连接这两点的路径都会得到相同结果（类似地，山丘上两点间的重力势能差，与测量时选择的路径无关）。以图31-6为例，我们选择另一条路径（从$a$点出发，逆时针经过电动势源到达$b$点）重新计算$\Delta V_{ab}$：
$$
V_{a}-\mathscr{E}+i R_{2}=V_{b}
$$
即：
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=+\mathscr{E}-i R_{2}
$$

将此结果与式31-3结合，仍可得到式31-4。

采用类似方法可推导出：
$$
\Delta V_{bc}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} \quad (31-5)
$$

显然，$\Delta V_{ab}+\Delta V_{bc}=\mathscr{E}$（与预期一致）。图31-6中这种电阻器组合被称为“分压器”，其作用是将电池的电压差按两个电阻器的阻值比例，分成两部分分配在两个电阻器上。

图31-7展示了该电路中电势差的另一种直观表示方式：为方便观察，我们从$c$点出发沿顺时针绕行电路，可清晰看到电池的电动势如何“分配”为两个电阻器两端的电势差。

#### 电动势源的内阻
与前文讨论的理想电池不同，实际电池存在内阻。内阻是电池制作材料的固有特性，无法移除——内阻会产生不良影响，如降低电池的端电压、限制电路中的最大电流，因此通常希望内阻越小越好。

图31-8在图31-5简单回路电路的基础上，加入了电池的内阻$r$。尽管电动势源和内阻属于同一器件，但我们在电路中仍将它们表示为两个独立元件。

图31-8的电路与图31-6的电路结构完全相同，只需将式31-3适配到图31-8的电路元件，即可求出电流：
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R+r} \quad (31-6)
$$

可见，内阻会减小电动势源向外部电路提供的电流。

电池两端的电势差为$\Delta V_{ab}=V_{a}-V_{b}=\mathscr{E}-i r$，将式31-6代入，可得：
$$
\Delta V_{ab}=\mathscr{E} \frac{R}{R+r} \quad (31-7)
$$

由上式可知，实际电池的端电压并非恒定值，而是依赖于外部电路的电阻$R$：$R$越小，电流越大，电池端电压越低。例如1.5V电池，只有当电路中无电流时，其端电压才等于1.5V；当电池连接收音机等电路器件时，端电压会低于1.5V。

从式31-7还可看出，只有当电池无内阻（$r=0$）或外部电路开路（$R=\infty$）时，$\Delta V_{ab}$才等于电动势$\mathscr{E}$。

#### 例题31-1
求图31-9a电路中的电流。已知电动势和电阻的数值为：$\mathscr{E}_{1}=2.1 ~V$、$\mathscr{E}_{2}=4.4 ~V$、$r_{1}=1.8 ~\Omega$、$r_{2}=2.3 ~\Omega$、$R=5.5 ~\Omega$。

解答：两个电动势反向串联，但由于$\mathscr{E}_{2}>\mathscr{E}_{1}$，电路电流方向由$\mathscr{E}_{2}$决定，为逆时针方向。从$a$点出发顺时针应用回路定则，可得：
$$
-\mathscr{E}_{2}+i r_{2}+i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=0
$$

可通过逆时针绕行或从其他点出发验证，确保得到相同方程；也可将方程与图31-9b（电势变化的图形表示）逐次对比。

求解电流$i$：
$$
i=\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{R+r_{1}+r_{2}}=\frac{4.4 ~V-2.1 ~V}{5.5 ~\Omega+1.8 ~\Omega+2.3 ~\Omega}=0.24 ~A
$$

无需提前知道电流方向：假设图31-9a中电流方向为顺时针（与实际箭头方向相反），从$a$点顺时针应用回路定则，可得：
$$
-\mathscr{E}_{2}-i r_{2}-i R-i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=0
$$
即：
$$
i=-\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{R+r_{1}+r_{2}}
$$

代入数值计算得$i=-0.24 ~A$，负号表明电流方向与假设方向相反。

#### 例题31-2
（a）求图31-9a中$a$、$b$两点间的电势差；（b）求图31-9a中$a$、$c$两点间的电势差。

解答（a）：$a$、$b$两点间的电势差即电池2的端电压（含电动势$\mathscr{E}_{2}$和内阻$r_{2}$）。从$b$点出发，逆时针经过电动势源到达$a$点，可得：
$$
V_{b}-i r_{2}+\mathscr{E}_{2}=V_{a}
$$
即：
$$
V_{a}-V_{b}=-i r_{2}+\mathscr{E}_{2}=-(0.24 ~A)(2.3 ~\Omega)+4.4 ~V=+3.8 ~V
$$

可见$a$点电势高于$b$点，且端电压（3.8V）小于电动势（4.4V）（见图31-9b）。

可通过另一条路径验证：从$b$点出发顺时针经过电路到达$a$点，可得：
$$
V_{b}+i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=V_{a}
$$
即：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
V_{a}-V_{b} & =i R+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1} \\ 
& =(0.24 ~A)(5.5 ~\Omega+1.8 ~\Omega)+2.1 ~V=+3.8 ~V, 
\end{aligned}
$$
结果与之前一致，证明两点间电势差与路径无关。

（b）$a$、$c$两点间的电势差即电池1的端电压（含电动势$\mathscr{E}_{1}$和内阻$r_{1}$）。从$c$点出发，顺时针经过电路到达$a$点，可得：
$$
V_{c}+i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=V_{a}
$$
即：
$$
V_{a}-V_{c}=i r_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{1}=(0.24 ~A)(1.8 ~\Omega)+2.1 ~V=+2.5 ~V
$$

可见$a$点电势高于$c$点，且端电压（2.5V）大于电动势（2.1V）（见图31-9b）。此时电荷被迫沿与电池1自身电动势驱动方向相反的方向流过$\mathscr{E}_{1}$：若$\mathscr{E}_{1}$是蓄电池，则它会以电池2（处于放电状态）的能量消耗为代价进行充电。

#### 例题31-3
图31-10展示了一个双回路电路，求电路中的电流。已知元件数值为：$\mathscr{E}_{1}=2.1 ~V$、$\mathscr{E}_{2}=6.3 ~V$、$R_{1}=1.7 ~\Omega$、$R_{2}=3.5 ~\Omega$。

解答：双回路电路分析的第一步是定义各支路的电流及方向。我们在三条支路中分别标注了电流$i_{1}$、$i_{2}$、$i_{3}$，并任意设定了方向。在$a$点，电流$i_{3}$流入，$i_{1}$和$i_{2}$流出，根据节点定则（31-1节）可得：
$$
i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}
$$

接下来对两个回路分别应用回路定则：从$a$点出发，逆时针绕行左侧回路，可得：
$$
-i_{1} R_{1}-\mathscr{E}_{1}-i_{1} R_{1}+\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{2} R_{2}=0
$$
整理得：
$$
2 i_{1} R_{1}-i_{2} R_{2}=\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}
$$

从$a$点出发，顺时针绕行右侧回路，可得：
$$
+i_{3} R_{1}-\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{3} R_{1}+i_{2} R_{2}=0
$$
将节点定则的$i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}$代入，整理得：
$$
2 i_{1} R_{1}+\left(2 R_{1}+R_{2}\right) i_{2}=0
$$

现在得到关于$i_{1}$和$i_{2}$的两个方程，通过代数运算求解：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
i_{1} & =\frac{\left(\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}\right)\left(2 R_{1}+R_{2}\right)}{4 R_{1}\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)} \\ 
& =\frac{(6.3 ~V-2.1 ~V)(2 \times 1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}{(4)(1.7 ~\Omega)(1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}=0.82 ~A, 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned} 
i_{2} & =-\frac{\mathscr{E}_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{1}}{2\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)} \\ 
& =-\frac{6.3 ~V-2.1 ~V}{(2)(1.7 ~\Omega+3.5 ~\Omega)}=-0.40 ~A 
\end{aligned}
$$

根据节点定则求第三条支路的电流$i_{3}$：
$$
i_{3}=i_{1}+i_{2}=0.82 ~A+(-0.40 ~A)=0.42 ~A
$$

电流的正负号表明：$i_{1}$和$i_{3}$的假设方向正确，而$i_{2}$的假设方向错误——在图31-10的中央支路中，$i_{2}$实际方向应向上而非向下。

需注意，发现$i_{2}$方向错误后，无需修改图31-10中的标注，只需在后续所有涉及$i_{2}$的计算中代入其负值即可。

#### 例题31-4
求图31-10电路中$a$、$b$两点间的电势差。

解答：假设电流方向如图31-10所示，沿$ab$支路从$a$到$b$分析，可得：
$$
V_{a}-i_{2} R_{2}-\mathscr{E}_{2}=V_{b}
$$
即：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
V_{a}-V_{b} & =\mathscr{E}_{2}+i_{2} R_{2} \\ 
& =6.3 ~V+(-0.40 ~A)(3.5 ~\Omega)=+4.9 ~V 
\end{aligned}
$$

正号表明$a$点电势高于$b$点。从电路图可直观预期此结果——所有电池的正极均朝向电路上方。


### 31-4 ELECTRIC FIELDS IN CIRCUITS
So far we have been discussing circuits in a rather mysterious way. In Chapter 29 we considered the relationship between current and electric field in a conductor: $\overrightarrow{E} = \rho \overrightarrow{j}$ (Eq. 29-10), where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material and $\overrightarrow{j}$ is the current density (current per unit cross-sectional area). The wires in our circuits are conductors, and so there must be an electric field present to establish and sustain the current. Where does this electric field come from?

It is helpful at this point to return to the analogy between current and fluid flow in a pipe. Figure 31-11 shows a closed loop similar to the circuit of Fig. 31-5. The pump is analogous to the source of emf, and the constriction in the pipe is analogous to the resistor. In the steady state, the amount of fluid per unit time passing any particular point in the circuit must be the same as that passing any other point. In the constriction, the fluid must therefore flow more rapidly (assuming the fluid to be incompressible).

The battery provides the emf to the circuit; its role is to “pump” charges from low potential to high potential. The emf is defined as the work per unit charge done by the battery. With the conventional definition of work done by a force $\overrightarrow{F}$ as $W = \int \overrightarrow{F} \cdot d\overrightarrow{s}$, the work per unit charge $W/q$ (the emf) must then be related to the force per unit charge $\overrightarrow{F}/q$:
$$
\mathscr{E} = \oint (\overrightarrow{F}/q) \cdot d\overrightarrow{s} \quad(31-8)
$$

It is tempting to associate an electric field with the quantity $F/q$, but it is generally not correct. The force $\overrightarrow{F}$ in this case is the one that acts inside the source of emf; it might be a force of mechanical, chemical, thermodynamic, or magnetic origin, but it is not necessarily associated with an electric field.

We have written Eq. 31-8 as the integral around a closed path. In this way, the emf depends only on the net effect of the source on a charge that makes a complete loop around the circuit. Conservative external fields cannot give an emf, because Eq. 31-8 vanishes for such fields.

Inside the wires, there is an electric field. This field must be present for charge to flow in the wires. (Recall from our discussion in Chapter 27 that the rule that $E = 0$ inside a conductor holds only under electrostatic conditions; when currents are present, this rule does not hold.)

Figure 31-12 shows a representation of the electric fields in a conducting wire. How large must the electric fields be to maintain a typical current?

It is helpful to make some numerical estimates. Suppose a current $i = 1\,\text{A}$ flows in a wire of radius $R = 1\,\text{mm}$. The current density is then
$$
j = \frac{i}{A} = \frac{1\,\text{A}}{\pi (1 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{m})^2} \approx 3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2.
$$

For copper wires, the resistivity $\rho$ is $1.69 \times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}$, so the electric field associated with the current is
$$
\begin{aligned}
E = \rho j & = (1.69 \times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m})(3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2) \\
& \approx 5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a very small electric field.

When the battery is first connected to the circuit, initial transient currents are established. These currents distribute charges along the surfaces of the wires in just the precise way necessary to establish the electric field that maintains the steady current in the wires—and the entire process takes place in a time that is typically of the order of nanoseconds!

How much charge on the surface of the wire is needed to produce a field of $5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m}$ in its interior? To find a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, we can use Eq. 26-6 for the electric field of a point charge to find the charge $q$ on the surface of the wire that would give a field $E$ at its center:
$$
\begin{aligned}
q = 4\pi \epsilon_0 R^2 E & = \frac{(10^{-3}\,\text{m})^2 (5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m})}{9 \times 10^9\,\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2} \\
& = 5.5 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C}
\end{aligned}
$$
or about 3.5 electrons! We need only tiny amounts of charge on the surface to provide the electric field needed to sustain even a current as large as one ampere in a conductor.

In a similar fashion, we can ask how the current “knows” to change direction when it encounters a bend in the wire. Once again, the initial transients must result in just enough charge on the surface to guide the current. Figure 31-13 shows a schematic view of a right-angle bend, for which the surface charges must be distributed roughly as shown. The negative charge sets up a field near the bend that opposes the motion of the oncoming current, and the positive charge provides an initial “push” in the new direction. The preceding calculation again gives an order-of-magnitude estimate of the necessary charges—a few electrons on the surface are sufficient to change the direction of a one-ampere current!

Consideration of surface charge can also help us understand the effect of a resistor in a circuit. Let us consider a carbon resistor, and for simplicity we will give it the same diameter as the wires in our circuit (Fig. 31-14). Carbon is a poor conductor, but not quite a good insulator—its resistivity is about $3 \times 10^{-5}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}$, about 2000 times larger than that of copper, but not nearly so large as that of typical insulators (see Table 29-1). Because the resistor and the wires have the same cross-sectional area, the current density is the same in both. Using our previous current density for the 1-A current in the 1-mm-radius wire, we can find the electric field in the resistor:
$$
E = \rho j = (3 \times 10^{-5}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m})(3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2) \approx 10\,\text{V/m},
$$
giving a field about 2000 times larger than the field in the copper wires. (Can you now see why the potential drop in the wires is negligible compared with the potential drop in the resistor?) This large electric field is necessary to force the electrons through the “constriction” in the circuit due to the resistor. As shown in Fig. 31-14, charges building up on the ends of the wire (similar to the charges on a capacitor) are responsible for producing this large electric field. For a resistor of thickness 1 mm, you should be able to show that about 1000 electrons on each end can produce the required field.

What we have described here is a wonderful, self-regulating system. The battery provides the initial “burst” of current to the circuit, and almost instantly the charge finds its way to the locations where it guides the steady current and prevents further build-up of charge on the surface of the wires. This equilibrium is maintained as long as the battery continues to pump charge around the circuit.


### 31-4 电路中的电场
截至目前，我们对电路的讨论仍带有一定的“神秘感”。在第29章中，我们探讨了导体中电流与电场的关系：$\overrightarrow{E} = \rho \overrightarrow{j}$（式29-10），其中$\rho$是材料的电阻率，$\overrightarrow{j}$是电流密度（单位横截面积的电流）。电路中的导线属于导体，因此必须存在电场才能建立并维持电流。那么，这个电场究竟来自何处？

此时，回归“电流与管道中流体流动的类比”会很有帮助。图31-11所示的闭合回路与图31-5的电路类似：泵相当于电动势源，管道中的狭窄部分相当于电阻。在稳态下，单位时间内流经电路中任意一点的流体量必须相等；因此，在狭窄部分，流体的流速会更快（假设流体不可压缩）。

电池为电路提供电动势，其作用是将电荷从低电势“泵”到高电势。电动势的定义是电池对单位电荷所做的功。根据力$\overrightarrow{F}$做功的常规定义$W = \int \overrightarrow{F} \cdot d\overrightarrow{s}$，单位电荷的功$W/q$（即电动势）必然与单位电荷所受的力$\overrightarrow{F}/q$相关，即：
$$
\mathscr{E} = \oint (\overrightarrow{F}/q) \cdot d\overrightarrow{s} \quad(31-8)
$$

人们可能会倾向于将$F/q$与电场关联，但这通常是不正确的。此处的力$\overrightarrow{F}$是作用在电动势源内部的力，其来源可能是机械力、化学力、热力或磁力，但不一定与电场相关。

我们将式31-8写成沿闭合路径的积分，这样电动势仅取决于电源对“完成一次回路运动的电荷”的净作用。保守外场无法产生电动势，因为对于保守场，式31-8的积分结果为零。

导线内部存在电场，正是这个电场使得电荷能够在导线中流动。（回顾第27章的讨论：“导体内部电场$E = 0$”的结论仅在静电条件下成立；当有电流存在时，该结论不再适用。）

图31-12展示了导体内电场的分布情况。要维持一个典型的电流，所需的电场强度究竟有多大？

我们可以通过数值估算来理解。假设电流$i = 1\,\text{A}$流过半径$R = 1\,\text{mm}$的导线，其电流密度为：
$$
j = \frac{i}{A} = \frac{1\,\text{A}}{\pi (1 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{m})^2} \approx 3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2.
$$

对于铜线，其电阻率$\rho = 1.69 \times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}$，因此与电流相关的电场强度为：
$$
\begin{aligned}
E = \rho j & = (1.69 \times 10^{-8}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m})(3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2) \\
& \approx 5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m}.
\end{aligned}
$$

这是一个非常微弱的电场。

当电池刚接入电路时，会先形成初始的暂态电流。这些暂态电流会将电荷精确地分布在导线表面，从而建立起维持导线中稳态电流所需的电场——整个过程通常在纳秒量级的时间内完成！

要在导线内部产生$5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m}$的电场，导线表面需要多少电荷？我们可以利用点电荷的电场公式（式26-6）进行粗略的数量级估算，求出能在导线中心产生电场$E$的表面电荷量$q$：
$$
\begin{aligned}
q = 4\pi \epsilon_0 R^2 E & = \frac{(10^{-3}\,\text{m})^2 (5 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{V/m})}{9 \times 10^9\,\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2} \\
& = 5.5 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C}
\end{aligned}
$$
这相当于约3.5个电子的电荷量！由此可见，即使要维持1安培这样较大的电流，也只需在导线表面分布极少量的电荷即可产生所需的电场。

类似地，我们可能会问：当电流遇到导线的弯折处时，它是如何“知道”改变方向的？答案仍是初始暂态电流的作用——暂态电流会在导线表面分布恰好足够的电荷，以引导电流方向。图31-13示意性地展示了直角弯折处的电荷分布：弯折处的负电荷会产生一个阻碍来流电流的电场，而正电荷则会对电流产生一个沿新方向的初始“推力”。通过前文的估算可知，只需表面的几个电子，就足以改变1安培电流的方向！

分析表面电荷的分布还能帮助我们理解电阻在电路中的作用。以碳膜电阻为例，为简化分析，假设其直径与电路中的导线相同（图31-14）。碳是不良导体（但并非绝缘体），其电阻率约为$3 \times 10^{-5}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m}$，是铜的约2000倍，但远小于典型绝缘体的电阻率（见表29-1）。由于电阻与导线的横截面积相同，两者的电流密度也相同。利用前文1安培电流在1毫米半径导线中的电流密度，可计算出电阻内部的电场强度：
$$
E = \rho j = (3 \times 10^{-5}\,\Omega \cdot \text{m})(3 \times 10^5\,\text{A/m}^2) \approx 10\,\text{V/m},
$$
该电场强度约为铜线内部电场的2000倍。（现在你应该明白，为什么导线的电势降落与电阻的电势降落相比可以忽略不计了吧？）要推动电子克服电阻对电路的“阻碍”，就需要这样强的电场。如图31-14所示，导线两端积累的电荷（类似电容器极板上的电荷）正是产生这一强电场的原因。对于厚度为1毫米的电阻，你可以自行验证：只需在其两端各分布约1000个电子，就能产生所需的电场。

我们前面描述的是一个精妙的自调节系统：电池为电路提供初始的“瞬时电流”，电荷几乎瞬间就会到达能引导稳态电流的位置，并阻止导线表面进一步积累电荷。只要电池持续为电路“泵送”电荷，这种平衡状态就会一直维持下去。


### 31-5 RESISTORS IN SERIES AND PARALLEL
As was the case with capacitors (see Section 30-4), resistors often occur in circuits in various combinations. In analyzing such circuits, it is helpful to replace the combination of resistors with a single equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$, whose value is chosen such that the operation of the circuit is unchanged. We consider two ways that resistors can be combined.

#### Resistors Connected in Parallel
Recall our definition of a parallel combination of circuit elements in Section 30-4: We can travel through the combination by crossing only one of the elements, the same potential difference $\Delta V$ appears across each element, and the flow of charge is shared among the elements.

Figure 31-15 shows two resistors connected in parallel. We seek the equivalent resistance between points $a$ and $b$. Let us assume we connect a battery (or other source of emf) that maintains a potential difference $\Delta V$ between points $a$ and $b$. The potential difference across each resistor is $\Delta V$. The current through each of the resistors is, from Eq. 29-12,
$$
i_1 = \Delta V / R_1 \quad \text{and} \quad i_2 = \Delta V / R_2. \quad(31-9)
$$

According to the properties of a parallel circuit, the total current $i$ must be shared among the branches, so
$$
i = i_1 + i_2. \quad(31-10)
$$

If we were to replace the parallel combination by a single equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$, the same total current $i$ must flow (because the replacement must not change the operation of the circuit). The current is then
$$
i = \Delta V / R_{\text{eq}}. \quad(31-11)
$$

Substituting Eqs. 31-9 and 31-11 into Eq. 31-10, we obtain
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{\Delta V}{R_1} + \frac{\Delta V}{R_2}
$$
or
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}. \quad(31-12)
$$

To find the equivalent resistance of a parallel combination of more than two resistors, we first find the equivalent resistance $R_{12}$ of $R_1$ and $R_2$ using Eq. 31-12. We then find the equivalent resistance of $R_{12}$ and the next parallel resistance, $R_3$, again using Eq. 31-12. Continuing in this way, we obtain a general expression for the equivalent resistance of a parallel combination of any number of resistors,
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \sum_{n} \frac{1}{R_n} \quad (\text{parallel combination}). \quad(31-13)
$$

That is, to find the equivalent resistance of a parallel combination, add the reciprocals of the individual resistances and take the reciprocal of the resulting sum. Note that $R_{\text{eq}}$ is always smaller than the smallest resistance in the parallel combination—by adding more paths for the current, we get more current for the same potential difference.

In the special case of two resistors in parallel, Eq. 31-12 can be written
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}, \quad(31-14)
$$
or as the product of the two resistances divided by their sum.

#### Resistors Connected in Series
Figure 31-16 shows two resistors connected in series. Recall the properties of a series combination of circuit elements (see Section 30-4): to travel through the combination, we must travel through all the elements in succession, the potential difference across the combination is the sum of the potential differences across each element, and the same current is maintained in each element.

Suppose a battery of potential difference $\Delta V$ is connected across points $a$ and $b$ in Fig. 31-16. A current $i$ is set up in the combination and in each of the resistors. The potential differences across the resistors are
$$
\Delta V_1 = i R_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta V_2 = i R_2. \quad(31-15)
$$

The sum of these potential differences must give the potential difference across points $a$ and $b$ maintained by the battery, or
$$
\Delta V = \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2. \quad(31-16)
$$

If we replaced the combination by its equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$, the same current $i$ would be established, and so
$$
\Delta V = i R_{\text{eq}}. \quad(31-17)
$$

Combining Eqs. 31-15, 31-16, and 31-17, we obtain
$$
i R_{\text{eq}} = i R_1 + i R_2,
$$
or
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2. \quad(31-18)
$$

Extending this result to a series combination of any number of resistors, we obtain
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \sum_{n} R_n \quad (\text{series combination}). \quad(31-19)
$$

That is, to find the equivalent resistance of a series combination, find the sum of the individual resistors. Note that the equivalent resistance of a series combination is always larger than the largest resistance in the series—adding more resistors in series means we get less current for the same potential difference.

Comparing these results with Eqs. 30-17 and 30-22 for the series and parallel combinations of capacitors, we see that resistors in parallel add like capacitors in series, and resistors in series add like capacitors in parallel. This has to do with the different way the two quantities are defined, resistance being potential/current and capacitance being charge/potential.

Occasionally, resistors may appear in combinations that are neither parallel nor series. In such a case, the equivalent resistance can sometimes be found by breaking the problem into smaller units that can be regarded as series or parallel connections, as the following sample problems demonstrate.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-5
(a) Find the equivalent resistance of the combination shown in Fig. 31-17a, using the values $R_1 = 4.6\,\Omega$, $R_2 = 3.5\,\Omega$, and $R_3 = 2.8\,\Omega$. (b) What is the value of the current through $R_1$ when a 12.0-V battery is connected across points $a$ and $b$?

**Solution**
(a) We first find the equivalent resistance $R_{12}$ of the parallel combination of $R_1$ and $R_2$. Using Eq. 31-14 we obtain
$$
R_{12} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{(4.6\,\Omega)(3.5\,\Omega)}{4.6\,\Omega + 3.5\,\Omega} = 2.0\,\Omega.
$$

$R_{12}$ and $R_3$ are in series, as shown in Fig. 31-17b. Using Eq. 31-18, we can find the equivalent resistance $R_{123}$ of this series combination, which is the equivalent resistance of the entire original combination:
$$
R_{123} = R_{12} + R_3 = 2.0\,\Omega + 2.8\,\Omega = 4.8\,\Omega.
$$

(b) With a 12.0-V battery connected across points $a$ and $b$ in Fig. 31-17c, the resulting current is
$$
i = \frac{\Delta V}{R_{123}} = \frac{12.0\,\text{V}}{4.8\,\Omega} = 2.5\,\text{A}.
$$

With this current in the series combination in Fig. 31-17b, the potential difference across $R_{12}$ is
$$
\Delta V_{12} = i R_{12} = (2.5\,\text{A})(2.0\,\Omega) = 5.0\,\text{V}.
$$

In a parallel combination, the same potential difference appears across each element (and across their combination). The potential difference across $R_1$ (and $R_2$) is therefore 5.0 V, and the current through $R_1$ is
$$
i_1 = \frac{\Delta V_{12}}{R_1} = \frac{5.0\,\text{V}}{4.6\,\Omega} = 1.1\,\text{A}.
$$

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-6
Figure 31-18a shows a cube made of 12 resistors, each of resistance $R$. Find $R_{12}$, the equivalent resistance across a cube edge.

**Solution**
Although this problem at first looks hopeless to divide into series and parallel subunits, the symmetry of the connections suggests a way to do so. The key is the realization that, from considerations of symmetry alone, points 3 and 6 must be at the same potential, and so must points 4 and 5.

If two points in a circuit have the same potential, the currents in the circuit do not change if you connect these points by a wire. There is no current in the wire because there is no potential difference between its ends. Points 3 and 6 may therefore be connected by a wire, and similarly points 4 and 5 may be connected.

This allows us to redraw the cube as in Fig. 31-18b. From this point, it is simply a matter of reducing the circuit between the input terminals to a single resistor, using the rules for resistors in series and in parallel. In Fig. 31-18c, we make a start by replacing five parallel combinations of two resistors by their equivalents, each of resistance $\frac{1}{2}R$.

In Fig. 31-18d, we have added the three resistors that are in series in the right-hand loop, obtaining a single equivalent resistance of $2R$. In Fig. 31-18e, we have replaced the two resistors that now form the right-hand loop by a single equivalent resistor $\frac{2}{5}R$. In so doing, it is useful to recall that the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is equal to their product divided by their sum (see Eq. 31-14).

In Fig. 31-18f, we have added the three series resistors of Fig. 31-18e, obtaining $\frac{7}{5}R$, and in Fig. 31-18g we have reduced this parallel combination to the single equivalent resistance that we seek—namely,
$$
R_{12} = \frac{1}{12}R
$$

You can also use these methods to find $R_{13}$, the equivalent resistance of a cube across a face diagonal, and $R_{17}$, the equivalent resistance across a body diagonal (see Problem 77).


### 31-5 电阻的串联与并联
与电容器（见30-4节）类似，电阻在电路中也常以多种组合形式存在。分析这类电路时，将电阻组合替换为单个等效电阻$R_{\text{eq}}$会非常简便——等效电阻的取值需满足电路工作状态不变的条件。下面将介绍电阻的两种基本组合方式。

#### 电阻的并联
回顾30-4节中电路元件并联的定义：电流通过并联组合时，只需经过其中一个元件；每个元件两端的电势差$\Delta V$相同；电荷的流动会在各元件间分配。

图31-15所示为两个电阻的并联电路，我们需要求解端点$a$和$b$之间的等效电阻。假设接入一个电池（或其他电动势源），使$a$、$b$两点间维持恒定电势差$\Delta V$，则每个电阻两端的电势差均为$\Delta V$。由式29-12可知，通过每个电阻的电流分别为：
$$
i_1 = \Delta V / R_1 \quad \text{且} \quad i_2 = \Delta V / R_2. \quad(31-9)
$$

根据并联电路的特性，总电流$i$需在各支路间分配，因此：
$$
i = i_1 + i_2. \quad(31-10)
$$

若将该并联组合替换为单个等效电阻$R_{\text{eq}}$，电路总电流$i$需保持不变（替换不能改变电路工作状态），此时电流满足：
$$
i = \Delta V / R_{\text{eq}}. \quad(31-11)
$$

将式31-9和式31-11代入式31-10，可得：
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{\Delta V}{R_1} + \frac{\Delta V}{R_2}
$$
整理得：
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}. \quad(31-12)
$$

若需求解两个以上电阻并联的等效电阻，可先利用式31-12求出$R_1$与$R_2$的等效电阻$R_{12}$，再将$R_{12}$与下一个并联电阻$R_3$再次代入式31-12求解，以此类推。由此可得到任意数量电阻并联时等效电阻的通用表达式：
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \sum_{n} \frac{1}{R_n} \quad (\text{并联组合}). \quad(31-13)
$$

也就是说，求解并联组合的等效电阻时，需先将各电阻的倒数相加，再对结果取倒数。需注意，并联电路的等效电阻$R_{\text{eq}}$始终小于组合中最小的电阻——增加电流的通路后，相同电势差下的总电流会增大。

对于两个电阻并联的特殊情况，可将式31-12改写为：
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}, \quad(31-14)
$$
即等效电阻等于两个电阻的乘积除以它们的和。

#### 电阻的串联
图31-16所示为两个电阻的串联电路。回顾30-4节中电路元件串联的特性：电流通过串联组合时，需依次经过所有元件；组合两端的总电势差等于各元件两端电势差之和；通过每个元件的电流相同。

假设在图31-16的$a$、$b$两点间接入一个电势差为$\Delta V$的电池，电路中会形成电流$i$，且通过两个电阻的电流均为$i$。各电阻两端的电势差分别为：
$$
\Delta V_1 = i R_1 \quad \text{且} \quad \Delta V_2 = i R_2. \quad(31-15)
$$

这些电势差之和等于电池在$a$、$b$两点间维持的总电势差，即：
$$
\Delta V = \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2. \quad(31-16)
$$

若将该串联组合替换为等效电阻$R_{\text{eq}}$，电路中的电流$i$仍保持不变，此时总电势差满足：
$$
\Delta V = i R_{\text{eq}}. \quad(31-17)
$$

联立式31-15、31-16和31-17，可得：
$$
i R_{\text{eq}} = i R_1 + i R_2,
$$
整理得：
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2. \quad(31-18)
$$

将该结果推广到任意数量电阻的串联组合，等效电阻的表达式为：
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \sum_{n} R_n \quad (\text{串联组合}). \quad(31-19)
$$

也就是说，求解串联组合的等效电阻时，只需将各电阻的阻值相加。需注意，串联电路的等效电阻$R_{\text{eq}}$始终大于组合中最大的电阻——增加串联电阻后，相同电势差下的总电流会减小。

将上述结果与30-4节中电容器串联（式30-17）和并联（式30-22）的等效电容公式对比可知：电阻的并联规律与电容器的串联规律相似，电阻的串联规律与电容器的并联规律相似。这一差异源于两个物理量的定义不同：电阻定义为“电势差/电流”，而电容定义为“电荷量/电势差”。

有时电阻的组合既非纯串联也非纯并联。这种情况下，可将电路拆解为多个可视为串联或并联的子单元，再逐步求解等效电阻，以下示例问题将演示这一方法。

#### 示例问题31-5
（a）如图31-17a所示，已知电阻值$R_1 = 4.6\,\Omega$、$R_2 = 3.5\,\Omega$、$R_3 = 2.8\,\Omega$，求该电阻组合的等效电阻。（b）若在$a$、$b$两点间接入12.0V电池，求通过$R_1$的电流。

**解答**
（a）首先求解$R_1$与$R_2$并联的等效电阻$R_{12}$，由式31-14可得：
$$
R_{12} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{(4.6\,\Omega)(3.5\,\Omega)}{4.6\,\Omega + 3.5\,\Omega} = 2.0\,\Omega.
$$

如图31-17b所示，$R_{12}$与$R_3$呈串联关系。由式31-18可求解该串联组合的等效电阻$R_{123}$（即原电路的总等效电阻）：
$$
R_{123} = R_{12} + R_3 = 2.0\,\Omega + 2.8\,\Omega = 4.8\,\Omega.
$$

（b）如图31-17c所示，在$a$、$b$两点间接入12.0V电池后，电路总电流为：
$$
i = \frac{\Delta V}{R_{123}} = \frac{12.0\,\text{V}}{4.8\,\Omega} = 2.5\,\text{A}.
$$

该电流流经图31-17b中的串联组合，因此$R_{12}$两端的电势差为：
$$
\Delta V_{12} = i R_{12} = (2.5\,\text{A})(2.0\,\Omega) = 5.0\,\text{V}.
$$

在并联组合中，各元件（及组合整体）两端的电势差相同，因此$R_1$（及$R_2$）两端的电势差为5.0V，通过$R_1$的电流为：
$$
i_1 = \frac{\Delta V_{12}}{R_1} = \frac{5.0\,\text{V}}{4.6\,\Omega} = 1.1\,\text{A}.
$$

#### 示例问题31-6
如图31-18a所示，由12个阻值均为$R$的电阻构成一个立方体，求立方体一条棱（如端点1和2之间）的等效电阻$R_{12}$。

**解答**
初看该问题，似乎无法将电阻拆解为串联或并联子单元，但电路的对称性为我们提供了思路：仅从对称性分析可知，端点3与6的电势必定相等，端点4与5的电势也必定相等。

若电路中两点电势相等，即使用导线将它们连接，电路中的电流也不会改变——因为导线两端无电势差，不会有电流流过。因此，可将端点3与6、端点4与5分别用导线连接。

基于此，可将立方体电路重绘为图31-18b的形式。此后，只需利用电阻串、并联的等效电阻公式，逐步将输入端之间的电路简化为单个电阻即可。在图31-18c中，首先将5个“两个电阻并联”的组合分别替换为等效电阻，每个等效电阻的阻值均为$\frac{1}{2}R$。

在图31-18d中，将右侧回路中3个串联的电阻合并，得到一个阻值为$2R$的等效电阻。在图31-18e中，将右侧回路中剩余的两个电阻替换为等效电阻$\frac{2}{5}R$——此处可利用“两个电阻并联时，等效电阻等于其乘积除以和”的规律（见式31-14）。

在图31-18f中，将图31-18e中3个串联的电阻合并，得到阻值为$\frac{7}{5}R$的等效电阻；最终在图31-18g中，将该并联组合简化为我们所求的单个等效电阻：
$$
R_{12} = \frac{1}{12}R
$$

利用类似方法，还可求解立方体面对角线（如端点1和3之间）的等效电阻$R_{13}$，以及体对角线（如端点1和7之间）的等效电阻$R_{17}$（见习题77）。


### 31-6 ENERGY TRANSFERS IN AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
Figure 31-19 shows a circuit consisting of a battery B connected to an electronic device, such as a resistor, a capacitor, a motor, or another battery. There is a current in the wires and a potential difference $\Delta V_{ab}$ between the terminals of the device.

Let us first consider the operation of the battery, which we assume is an ideal (resistanceless) source of emf $\mathscr{E}$. As the battery moves a quantity of charge $dq$ from its negative terminal to its positive terminal, it does work on the charge given by Eq. 31-1: $dW = \mathscr{E}dq$. The power delivered by the source of emf is determined by the rate at which work is being done; that is, $P_{\text{emf}} = dW/dt = \mathscr{E}dq/dt$ or
$$
P_{\text{emf}} = \mathscr{E}i. \quad(31-20)
$$

This quantity gives the rate at which an ideal source of emf transfers energy to the rest of the circuit. As we discussed in Section 31-2, this energy might appear as the internal energy of a resistor, stored energy in the electric field of a capacitor, mechanical energy in a motor, or chemical energy in a battery that is being charged. If we consider the circuit to be an isolated system, then its total energy cannot change, and the decrease in energy of the source of emf must be balanced by an equivalent net increase in energy in the other parts of the circuit.

Suppose the circuit consists only of a source of emf and a resistor $R$. The potential difference between terminals $a$ and $b$ in Fig. 31-19 is $\Delta V_R = iR$. As a quantity of charge $dq$ moves through the resistor from $a$ to $b$, it experiences a potential energy change $dU = dq\Delta V_R$ (see Eq. 28-14). This energy must be transferred to the resistor, so the power transferred to the resistor (rate of energy transfer) is $P_R = dU/dt = (dq/dt)\Delta V_R = i\Delta V_R$ or
$$
P_R = i^2R. \quad(31-21)
$$

With $i = \Delta V_R/R$, we can also write this result as
$$
P_R = \frac{(\Delta V_R)^2}{R}. \quad(31-22)
$$

This energy transfer to a resistor in a circuit is often known as Joule heating.

As charge moves through the resistor from higher potential (terminal $a$) to lower potential (terminal $b$), it would tend to gain energy if it were not for the collisions with the atoms of the resistor. These collisions maintain the constant drift speed of the charge carriers, and the energy gained by the atoms in these collisions (which results in an increase in the amplitude of the vibration of the atoms about their equilibrium positions) can correspond to a temperature increase.

This situation is analogous to the falling of a stone at its terminal velocity through a viscous medium such as air or water. As the stone falls in gravity, its decrease in potential energy is immediately transformed—not into an increase in its kinetic energy, but into an increase in the internal energy of the stone and the surrounding medium.

In a real battery with internal resistance $r$, the potential difference between the terminals is $\Delta V_{\text{batt}} = \mathscr{E} - ir$, and the charge passing through the battery gains potential energy $dU = dq\Delta V_{\text{batt}} = dq(\mathscr{E} - ir)$. The power delivered by this battery is $P_{\text{batt}} = dU/dt$, or
$$
P_{\text{batt}} = \mathscr{E}i - i^2r = P_{\text{emf}} - P_r. \quad(31-23)
$$

The energy available to the rest of the circuit is decreased by the Joule heating in the internal resistance.

The unit of power that follows from Eqs. 31-20 to 31-22 is the volt-ampere, which you can show to be equivalent to the watt by using the definitions of the volt (joule/coulomb) and ampere (coulomb/second).

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-7
You are given a length of heating wire made of a nickel-chromium-iron alloy called Nichrome; it has a resistance $R$ of 72 $\Omega$. It is to be connected across a 120-V line. Under which circumstances will the wire dissipate more heat: (a) its entire length is connected across the line, or (b) the wire is cut in half and the two halves are connected in parallel across the line?

**Solution**
(a) The power $P_R$ dissipated by the entire wire is, from Eq. 31-22,
$$
P_R = \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{R} = \frac{(120\,\text{V})^2}{72\,\Omega} = 200\,\text{W}.
$$

(b) The power for a wire of half length (and thus half resistance) is
$$
P_R' = \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{\frac{1}{2}R} = \frac{(120\,\text{V})^2}{36\,\Omega} = 400\,\text{W}.
$$

There are two halves, so the power obtained from both of them is 800 W, or four times that for the single wire. This would seem to suggest that you could buy a heating wire, cut it in half, and reconnect it to obtain four times the heat output. Why is this not such a good idea?


### 31-6 电路中的能量转移
图31-19所示电路包含一个电池B和一个电子器件（如电阻、电容器、电动机或另一个电池）。电路导线中有电流流过，且该电子器件两端存在电势差$\Delta V_{ab}$。

首先分析电池的工作过程，假设该电池为理想（无内阻）电动势源$\mathscr{E}$。当电池将电荷量$dq$从负极转移到正极时，它对电荷所做的功可由式31-1表示：$dW = \mathscr{E}dq$。电动势源的输出功率由做功速率决定，即$P_{\text{emf}} = dW/dt = \mathscr{E}dq/dt$，因此：
$$
P_{\text{emf}} = \mathscr{E}i. \quad(31-20)
$$

该式表示理想电动势源向电路其他部分转移能量的速率。如31-2节所述，这些能量可能以多种形式存在：电阻的内能、电容器电场中的储存能、电动机的机械能，或被充电电池中的化学能。若将电路视为孤立系统，其总能量守恒，因此电动势源减少的能量必须与电路其他部分增加的总能量相等。

假设电路中仅包含电动势源和电阻$R$。图31-19中端子$a$和$b$之间的电势差为$\Delta V_R = iR$。当电荷量$dq$从$a$流经电阻到$b$时，其电势能变化为$dU = dq\Delta V_R$（见式28-14）。这些能量会全部转移到电阻上，因此电阻的能量接收功率（能量转移速率）为$P_R = dU/dt = (dq/dt)\Delta V_R = i\Delta V_R$，即：
$$
P_R = i^2R. \quad(31-21)
$$

结合$i = \Delta V_R/R$，也可将上式改写为：
$$
P_R = \frac{(\Delta V_R)^2}{R}. \quad(31-22)
$$

电路中电阻的这种能量转移过程通常被称为焦耳热（Joule heating）。

当电荷从高电势端（端子$a$）流经电阻到低电势端（端子$b$）时，若没有电荷与电阻原子的碰撞，电荷的能量会不断增加。而碰撞会维持电荷载流子的恒定漂移速度，原子在碰撞中获得的能量（表现为原子在平衡位置附近的振动幅度增大）会使电阻温度升高。

这种情况类似于石块以终端速度在空气或水等黏性介质中下落：石块在重力作用下下落时，其减少的重力势能不会转化为动能的增加，而是立即转化为石块和周围介质的内能。

对于有内阻$r$的实际电池，其端电压为$\Delta V_{\text{batt}} = \mathscr{E} - ir$。当电荷流经电池时，获得的电势能为$dU = dq\Delta V_{\text{batt}} = dq(\mathscr{E} - ir)$。因此，电池的输出功率为$P_{\text{batt}} = dU/dt$，即：
$$
P_{\text{batt}} = \mathscr{E}i - i^2r = P_{\text{emf}} - P_r. \quad(31-23)
$$

由于内阻的焦耳热消耗，电路其他部分可利用的能量会减少。

由式31-20至式31-22可知，功率的单位为“伏特·安培”（volt-ampere）。根据伏特（焦耳/库仑）和安培（库仑/秒）的定义，可证明“伏特·安培”与“瓦特”（watt）等价。

#### 示例问题31-7
现有一段镍铬铁合金（俗称镍铬合金）加热丝，电阻$R = 72\,\Omega$，需连接在120V电路中。以下哪种情况下加热丝的散热功率更大？（a）将整段加热丝接入电路；（b）将加热丝剪成两段，再将两段并联接入电路。

**解答**
（a）由式31-22可知，整段加热丝的散热功率为：
$$
P_R = \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{R} = \frac{(120\,\text{V})^2}{72\,\Omega} = 200\,\text{W}.
$$

（b）加热丝剪成两段后，每段长度减半，电阻也减半（设为$\frac{1}{2}R$）。单段加热丝的散热功率为：
$$
P_R' = \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{\frac{1}{2}R} = \frac{(120\,\text{V})^2}{36\,\Omega} = 400\,\text{W}.
$$

两段并联的总散热功率为$400\,\text{W} \times 2 = 800\,\text{W}$，是整段加热丝的4倍。从理论上看，似乎可以通过剪断加热丝再并联的方式获得4倍的散热功率，但为何这种做法并不可取？


### 31-7 RC CIRCUITS
The preceding sections dealt with circuits containing only resistors, in which the currents did not vary with time. Here we introduce the capacitor as a circuit element, which leads us to the study of time-varying currents.

Suppose we charge the capacitor in Fig. 31-20 by throwing switch S to position a (Later we consider the connection to position b). What current is set up in the resulting single-loop circuit? Let us apply conservation of energy principles.

In time $dt$ a charge $dq(=idt)$ moves through any cross section of the circuit and is deposited on the positive plate of the capacitor. The work $= dq$ (see Eq. 31-1) done by the source of emf must equal the internal energy $(=i²Rdt)$ produced in the resistor during time $dt$ plus the increase $dU$ in the amount of energy $U(=q²/2C)$ (see Eq. 30-24) that is stored in the capacitor. Conservation of energy gives:
$$
\mathscr{E} dq = i²R dt + d\left(\frac{q²}{2C}\right)
$$
or
$$
\mathscr{E} dq = i²R dt + \frac{q}{C} dq
$$

Dividing by $dt$ yields:
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} = i²R + \frac{q}{C} \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

Since q is the charge on the upper plate, positive i means positive dq/dt. With $i = dq/dt$ this equation becomes:
$$
\mathscr{E} = iR + \frac{q}{C} \quad(31-24)
$$

Equation 31-24 also follows from the loop rule, as it must, since the loop rule was derived from the conservation of energy principle. Starting from point x and going around the circuit clockwise, we experience an increase in potential in going through the source of emf and decreases in potential in going through the resistor and the capacitor, or:
$$
\mathscr{E} - iR - \frac{q}{C} = 0
$$
which is identical to Eq. 31-24.

To solve Eq. 31-24, we first substitute dq/dt for i which gives:
$$
\mathscr{E} = R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} \quad(31-25)
$$

We can rewrite Eq. 31-25 as:
$$
\frac{dq}{q - \mathscr{E}C} = -\frac{dt}{RC} \quad(31-26)
$$

Integrating this result in the case that $q=0$ at $t=0$, we obtain (after solving for q):
$$
q = C\mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right) \quad(31-27)
$$

We can check that this function $q(t)$ is really a solution of Eq. 31-25 by substituting it and its first derivative into that equation and seeing whether an identity results. Differentiating Eq. 31-27 with respect to time yields:
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} e^{-t/RC} \quad(31-28)
$$

Substituting q (Eq. 31-27) and dq/dt (Eq. 31-28) into Eq. 31-25 yields an identity, as you should verify. Equation 31-27 is therefore a solution of Eq. 31-25.

In the laboratory we can determine i and q conveniently by measuring quantities that are proportional to them—namely, the potential difference $\Delta V_R(=iR)$ across the resistor and the potential difference $\Delta V_C(=q/C)$ across the capacitor. Such measurements can be obtained rather easily by connecting voltmeters (or oscilloscope probes) across the resistor and the capacitor. Figure 31-21 shows the resulting plots of $\Delta V_R$ and $\Delta V_C$. Note the following: (1) At $t=0$, $\Delta V_R=\mathscr{E}$ (the full potential difference appears across R), and $\Delta V_C=0$ (the capacitor is not charged). (2) As $t \to \infty$, $\Delta V_C \to \mathscr{E}$ (the capacitor becomes fully charged), and $\Delta V_R \to 0$ (the current stops flowing). (3) At all times, $\Delta V_R + \Delta V_C = \mathscr{E}$ as Eq. 31-25 requires.

The quantity $RC$ in Eqs. 31-27 and 31-28 has the dimensions of time and is called the capacitive time constant $\tau_C$ of the circuit:
$$
\tau_C = RC \quad(31-29)
$$

It is the time at which the charge on the capacitor has increased to within a factor of $1 - e^{-1}(≈63\%)$ of its final value $C\mathscr{E}$. To show this, we put $t = \tau_C = RC$ in Eq. 31-27 to obtain:
$$
q = C\mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-1}\right) = 0.63C\mathscr{E}
$$

Figure 31-21a shows that if a resistance is included in a circuit with a charging capacitor, the increase of the charge of the capacitor toward its limiting value is delayed by a time characterized by the time constant $RC$. With no resistor present $(RC=0)$ the charge would rise immediately to its limiting value. Although we have shown that this time delay follows from an application of the loop rule to $RC$ circuits, it is important to develop a physical understanding of the causes of the delay.

When switch S in Fig. 31-20 is closed on a the charge on the capacitor is initially zero, so the potential difference across the capacitor is initially zero. At this time, Eq. 31-24 shows that $\mathscr{E}=iR$, and so $i = \mathscr{E}/R$ at $t=0$. Because of this current, charge flows to the capacitor and the potential difference across the capacitor increases with time. Equation 31-24 now shows that, because the emf is a constant, any increase in the potential difference across the capacitor must be balanced by a corresponding decrease in the potential difference across the resistor, with a similar decrease in the current. This decrease in the current means that the charge on the capacitor increases more slowly. This process continues until the current decreases to zero, at which time there is no potential drop across the resistor. The entire potential difference of the emf now appears across the capacitor, which is fully charged $(q = C\mathscr{E})$. Unless changes are made in the circuit, there is no further flow of charge. Review the derivations of Eqs. 31-27 and 31-28 and study Fig. 31-20 with the qualitative arguments of this paragraph in mind.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-8
A resistor $R(=6.2M\Omega)$ and a capacitor $C(=2.4\mu F)$ are connected in series, and a 12-V battery of negligible internal resistance is connected across their combination. (a) What is the capacitive time constant of this circuit? (b) At what time after the battery is connected does the potential difference across the capacitor equal 5.6 V?

**Solution**
(a) From Eq. 31-29:
$$
\tau_C = RC = (6.2×10^6\Omega)(2.4×10^{-6}F) = 15s
$$

(b) The potential difference across the capacitor is $\Delta V_C = q/C$ which according to Eq. 31-27 can be written:
$$
\Delta V_C = \frac{q}{C} = \mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)
$$

Solving for $t$, we obtain (using $\tau_C = RC$):
$$
t = -\tau_C \ln\left(1 - \frac{\Delta V_C}{\mathscr{E}}\right) = -(15s) \ln\left(1 - \frac{5.6V}{12V}\right) = 9.4s
$$

As we found above, after a time $\tau_C(=15s)$ the potential difference across the capacitor is $0.63\mathscr{E}=7.6V$. It is reasonable that in a shorter time of 9.4 s, the potential difference across the capacitor reaches only the smaller value of 5.6 V.

### Discharging a Capacitor
Assume now that the switch S in Fig. 31-20 has been in position a for a time that is much greater than $RC$. For all practical purposes, the capacitor is fully charged, and no charge is flowing. The switch S is then thrown to position b. How do the charge of the capacitor and the current vary with time?

With the switch S closed on b the capacitor discharges through the resistor. There is no emf in the circuit and Eq. 31-24 for the circuit, with $\mathscr{E}=0$ becomes simply:
$$
iR + \frac{q}{C} = 0 \quad(31-30)
$$

Putting $i = dq/dt$ allows us to write the equation of the circuit (compare Eq. 31-25) as:
$$
R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} = 0 \quad(31-31)
$$

The solution is, as you may readily derive by integration (after writing $dq/q = -dt/RC$) and verify by substitution:
$$
q = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C} \quad(31-32)
$$
$q_0$ being the initial charge on the capacitor $= C\mathscr{E}$ in our case). The capacitive time constant $\tau_C(=RC)$ appears in this expression for a discharging capacitor as well as in that for a charging capacitor (Eq. 31-27). We see that at a time such that the capacitor charge is reduced to $q_0 e^{-1}$, which is about 37% of the initial charge $q_0$.

Differentiating Eq. 31-32, we find the current during discharge:
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = -\frac{q_0}{RC} e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$

The negative sign shows that the current is in the direction opposite to that shown in Fig. 31-20. This is as it should be, since the capacitor is discharging rather than charging. If the capacitor is originally fully charged, then, and we can write Eq. 31-33 as:
$$
i = -\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} e^{-t/\tau_C} \quad(31-34)
$$

The initial current, found by setting $t=0$ in Eq. 31-34, is $-\mathscr{E}/R$. This is reasonable because the initial potential difference across the resistor is $\mathscr{E}$.

The potential differences across R and C, which are, respectively, proportional to i and q can again be measured as indicated in Fig. 31-20. Typical results are shown in Fig. 31-22. Note that, as suggested by Eq. 31-32, $\Delta V_C(=q/C)$ falls exponentially from its maximum value, which occurs at $t=0$, whereas $\Delta V_R(=iR)$ is negative and rises exponentially to zero. Note also that $\Delta V_C + \Delta V_R = 0$, as required by Eq. 31-30.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 31-9
A capacitor C discharges through a resistor R. (a) After how many time constants does its charge fall to one-half its initial value? (b) After how many time constants does the stored energy drop to half its initial value?

**Solution**
(a) The charge on the capacitor varies according to Eq. 31-32:
$$
q = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$
in which $q_0$ is the initial charge. We seek the time t at which $q = \frac{1}{2}q_0$, or:
$$
\frac{1}{2}q_0 = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$

Canceling $q_0$ and taking the natural logarithm of each side, we find:
$$
-\ln 2 = -\frac{t}{\tau_C}
$$
or
$$
t = (\ln 2)\tau_C = 0.69\tau_C
$$

The charge drops to half its initial value after 0.69 time constants.

(b) The energy stored in the capacitor is:
$$
U = \frac{q²}{2C} = \frac{q_0²}{2C} e^{-2t/\tau_C} = U_0 e^{-2t/\tau_C}
$$
in which $U_0$ is the initial stored energy. The time at which $U = \frac{1}{2}U_0$ is found from:
$$
\frac{1}{2}U_0 = U_0 e^{-2t/\tau_C}
$$

Canceling $U_0$ and taking the logarithm of each side, we obtain:
$$
-\ln 2 = -2t/\tau_C
$$
or
$$
t = \tau_C \frac{\ln 2}{2} = 0.35\tau_C
$$

The stored energy drops to half its initial value after 0.35 time constants have elapsed. This remains true no matter what the initial stored energy may be. The time $(0.69\tau_C)$ needed for the charge to fall to half its initial value is greater than the time $(0.35\tau_C)$ needed for the energy to fall to half its initial value. Why?

### 31-7 RC电路
前面几节讨论的是仅含电阻的电路，这类电路中的电流不随时间变化。本节将电容器引入电路元件，由此展开对时变电流的研究。

如图31-20所示，将开关S拨至位置a给电容器充电（后续再考虑拨至位置b的情况）。在形成的单回路电路中，会产生怎样的电流？我们采用能量守恒定律进行分析。

在时间$dt$内，电荷$dq(=idt)$流经电路的任意横截面并沉积在电容器的正极板上。电源电动势做的功$= dq$（见式31-1），必须等于这段时间内电阻产生的内能$(=i²Rdt)$与电容器储存能量$U(=q²/2C)$的增加量$dU$（见式30-24）之和。根据能量守恒定律：
$$
\mathscr{E} dq = i²R dt + d\left(\frac{q²}{2C}\right)
$$
或
$$
\mathscr{E} dq = i²R dt + \frac{q}{C} dq
$$

两边除以$dt$得：
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} = i²R + \frac{q}{C} \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

由于q是上极板的电荷量，正电流意味着正的dq/dt。将$i = dq/dt$代入上式，可得：
$$
\mathscr{E} = iR + \frac{q}{C} \quad(31-24)
$$

式31-24也可由回路定则推导得出（这是必然的，因为回路定则源于能量守恒定律）。从点x出发顺时针绕行回路，经过电源电动势时电势升高，经过电阻和电容器时电势降低，因此：
$$
\mathscr{E} - iR - \frac{q}{C} = 0
$$
该式与式31-24完全一致。

为求解式31-24，先将i替换为dq/dt，得到：
$$
\mathscr{E} = R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} \quad(31-25)
$$

可将式31-25改写为：
$$
\frac{dq}{q - \mathscr{E}C} = -\frac{dt}{RC} \quad(31-26)
$$

在$t=0$时$q=0$的初始条件下对等式积分（求解q后），可得：
$$
q = C\mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right) \quad(31-27)
$$

将该函数$q(t)$及其一阶导数代入式31-25，可验证其是否为方程的解（读者可自行验证）。对式31-27关于时间求导，得到电流表达式：
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} e^{-t/RC} \quad(31-28)
$$

将q（式31-27）和dq/dt（式31-28）代入式31-25，可验证等式恒成立，因此式31-27是式31-25的解。

在实验室中，可通过测量与i和q成正比的物理量来间接确定它们——即电阻两端的电势差$\Delta V_R(=iR)$和电容器两端的电势差$\Delta V_C(=q/C)$。只需在电阻和电容器两端连接电压表（或示波器探头）即可实现测量，图31-21给出了$\Delta V_R$和$\Delta V_C$的典型变化曲线。需注意以下几点：（1）在$t=0$时，$\Delta V_R=\mathscr{E}$（全部电势差加在电阻上），$\Delta V_C=0$（电容器未充电）；（2）当$t \to \infty$时，$\Delta V_C \to \mathscr{E}$（电容器充满电），$\Delta V_R \to 0$（电流停止流动）；（3）任何时刻都满足$\Delta V_R + \Delta V_C = \mathscr{E}$，与式31-25的要求一致。

式31-27和式31-28中的$RC$具有时间量纲，称为电路的电容时间常数$\tau_C$：
$$
\tau_C = RC \quad(31-29)
$$

它表示电容器电荷量增长到最终值$C\mathscr{E}$的$1 - e^{-1}(≈63\%)$所需的时间。将$t = \tau_C = RC$代入式31-27，可得：
$$
q = C\mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-1}\right) = 0.63C\mathscr{E}
$$

图31-21a表明，当充电电路中包含电阻时，电容器电荷量向极限值的增长会受到延迟，延迟时间由时间常数$RC$表征。若电路中无电阻$(RC=0)$，电荷量会立即达到极限值。尽管我们已通过回路定则推导出RC电路的这一延迟特性，但仍需从物理本质上理解延迟的原因。

当开关S拨至位置a时，电容器初始电荷量为零，因此其两端初始电势差也为零。此时由式31-24可知$\mathscr{E}=iR$，故$t=0$时的电流$i = \mathscr{E}/R$。在该电流作用下，电荷流向电容器，使其两端电势差随时间增大。由于电动势恒定，根据式31-24，电容器两端电势差的任何增加都必须由电阻两端电势差的相应减小来平衡，电流也会随之减小。电流减小导致电容器电荷量增长变慢，这一过程持续到电流降至零，此时电阻两端无电势降落，电源的全部电势差都加在电容器上，电容器充满电$(q = C\mathscr{E})$。除非改变电路结构，否则不会再发生电荷流动。结合本段的定性分析，回顾式31-27和式31-28的推导过程，并研究图31-20。

#### 示例问题31-8
一个电阻$R(=6.2M\Omega)$和一个电容器$C(=2.4\mu F)$串联，再与一个内阻可忽略的12V电池相连。（a）该电路的电容时间常数是多少？（b）电池连接后多久，电容器两端的电势差达到5.6V？

**解答**
（a）由式31-29可得：
$$
\tau_C = RC = (6.2×10^6\Omega)(2.4×10^{-6}F) = 15s
$$

（b）电容器两端的电势差$\Delta V_C = q/C$，结合式31-27可写为：
$$
\Delta V_C = \frac{q}{C} = \mathscr{E}\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)
$$

求解t（利用$\tau_C = RC$）：
$$
t = -\tau_C \ln\left(1 - \frac{\Delta V_C}{\mathscr{E}}\right) = -(15s) \ln\left(1 - \frac{5.6V}{12V}\right) = 9.4s
$$

如前文所述，经过时间$\tau_C(=15s)$后，电容器两端的电势差为$0.63\mathscr{E}=7.6V$。因此，在更短的9.4s内，电容器两端电势差仅达到5.6V是合理的。

### 电容器的放电
假设开关S在位置a停留的时间远大于$RC$，此时电容器实际上已充满电，电路中无电荷流动。将开关S拨至位置b后，电容器的电荷量和电流会随时间如何变化？

开关S拨至位置b时，电容器通过电阻放电。电路中无电动势，式31-24中$\mathscr{E}=0$，因此简化为：
$$
iR + \frac{q}{C} = 0 \quad(31-30)
$$

将$i = dq/dt$代入，可得电路方程（对比式31-25）：
$$
R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} = 0 \quad(31-31)
$$

通过积分（改写为$dq/q = -dt/RC$后）可推导得出该方程的解（读者可自行推导并验证）：
$$
q = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C} \quad(31-32)
$$
其中$q_0$是电容器的初始电荷量（本题中$q_0 = C\mathscr{E}$）。电容时间常数$\tau_C(=RC)$既出现在充电电容器的表达式中（式31-27），也出现在放电电容器的表达式中。可见，经过时间$\tau_C$后，电容器的电荷量降至初始值$q_0$的$e^{-1}$倍，约为初始电荷量的37%。

对式31-32求导，得到放电过程中的电流：
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = -\frac{q_0}{RC} e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$

负号表明电流方向与图31-20中所示方向相反，这与电容器放电而非充电的物理过程一致。若电容器初始已充满电，则$q_0 = C\mathscr{E}$，式31-33可写为：
$$
i = -\frac{\mathscr{E}}{R} e^{-t/\tau_C} \quad(31-34)
$$

将$t=0$代入式31-34，可得初始电流为$-\mathscr{E}/R$。这一结果合理，因为初始时电阻两端的电势差为$\mathscr{E}$。

电阻R和电容器C两端的电势差分别与电流i和电荷量q成正比，可按图31-20所示方式测量，典型结果如图31-22所示。由式31-32可知，$\Delta V_C(=q/C)$从$t=0$时的最大值呈指数衰减至零；而$\Delta V_R(=iR)$为负值，呈指数增长至零。同时，$\Delta V_C + \Delta V_R = 0$，与式31-30的要求一致。

#### 示例问题31-9
一个电容器C通过电阻R放电。（a）经过多少个时间常数后，其电荷量降至初始值的一半？（b）经过多少个时间常数后，储存的能量降至初始值的一半？

**解答**
（a）电容器的电荷量随时间变化遵循式31-32：
$$
q = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$
其中$q_0$是初始电荷量。我们需要找到电荷量$q = \frac{1}{2}q_0$时的时间t：
$$
\frac{1}{2}q_0 = q_0 e^{-t/\tau_C}
$$

消去$q_0$并对两边取自然对数：
$$
-\ln 2 = -\frac{t}{\tau_C}
$$
解得：
$$
t = (\ln 2)\tau_C = 0.69\tau_C
$$

电荷量降至初始值的一半需要0.69个时间常数。

（b）电容器储存的能量为：
$$
U = \frac{q²}{2C} = \frac{q_0²}{2C} e^{-2t/\tau_C} = U_0 e^{-2t/\tau_C}
$$
其中$U_0$是初始储存能量。找到能量$U = \frac{1}{2}U_0$时的时间t：
$$
\frac{1}{2}U_0 = U_0 e^{-2t/\tau_C}
$$

消去$U_0$并对两边取对数：
$$
-\ln 2 = -2t/\tau_C
$$
解得：
$$
t = \tau_C \frac{\ln 2}{2} = 0.35\tau_C
$$

储存的能量降至初始值的一半需要0.35个时间常数，该结果与初始储存能量的大小无关。电荷量降至初始值一半所需的时间$(0.69\tau_C)$大于能量降至初始值一半所需的时间$(0.35\tau_C)$，原因是什么？
