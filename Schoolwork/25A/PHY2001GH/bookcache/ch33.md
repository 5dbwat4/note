### 33-1 运动电荷产生的磁场（英文原文）
In the previous chapter we discussed the force experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. By analogy with the electric field, in which charged particles at rest are both the sources of the field and its probe, we might expect that moving electric charges, which we have already shown to be probes of the magnetic field, could also serve as sources of the field.

This expectation was first demonstrated in 1820 by Hans Christian Oersted*, who observed that, as illustrated in Fig. 33-1, when a compass is placed near a straight wire carrying a current, the compass needle aligns so that it is tangent to a circle drawn around the wire (neglecting the influence of the Earth’s magnetic field on the compass). Oersted’s discovery provided the first link between electricity and magnetism.

Direct experimental evidence for the magnetic field of a moving charge did not come until 1876 in an experiment by Henry Rowland.** Rowland’s experiment is shown schematically in Fig. 33-2. He prepared a disk of charge (by connecting a battery to a layer of gold deposited on the surface of a disk of insulating material). By rotating the disk about its axis, he was able to produce moving charges, and he showed their magnetic effect by suspending a magnetized needle near the disk.

Our goal in this chapter is to study the magnetic interaction between two moving charges, just as Coulomb studied the electric interaction between charges at rest. Coulomb was able to measure the electrostatic force directly, and in principle we should be able to do the same—that is, to measure the magnetic force between two charges in motion. Unfortunately, the force is extremely small and very difficult to measure; in Rowland’s experiment, for example, the magnetic field produced by his rotating charged disk was only 0.00001 of the Earth’s field!

Despite the extremely small size of the magnetic field of a single moving charge, it is conceptually easier to begin our study of the sources of the magnetic field with a discussion of how a single moving charge produces a magnetic field. Later we will see why this approach is not practical and why it is easier for us to produce magnetic fields in the laboratory by using moving charges in the form of currents in wires.

Let us therefore conduct a “thought experiment” in which we project a single charge q with velocity $\vec{v}$ and detect the field with a suspended magnetic needle that is free to align in any direction. To avoid problems with relativity, we will need to keep the speed of the particle small (compared with the speed of light) in our reference frame. We set up the experiment in a region in which the Earth's magnetic field is negligible. (It is not necessary to journey to outer space to find this region; we can use current-carrying coils in our laboratories to create fields that cancel the Earth’s field.) Figure 33-3a shows the outcome of some measurements of the magnetic field at different locations. The moving charge sets up a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$, and the needle indicates the direction of the field at any location. In principle we could also determine the magnitude of the field, such as by measuring the force on a second moving charged particle, as we described in Section 32-2.

If we could actually perform these experiments, we would discover some properties of the magnetic field due to a moving charge:
1. The field strength is directly proportional to the magnitude of the velocity and also to the charge q.
2. If $\overrightarrow{v}$ reverses direction or q changes sign, the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$ is reversed.
3. The field is zero at points along the direction of $\vec{v}$ (forward as well as backward). In other directions relative to $\vec{v}$ as shown in Fig. 33-3a, the field varies as sin ϕ.
4. $\overrightarrow{B}$ is tangent to circles drawn about $\overrightarrow{v}$ in planes perpendicular to $\vec{v}$ with the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$ determined by a right-hand rule (point your thumb in the direction $\vec{v}$, and your fingers will curl in the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$). On any given circle, the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{B}$ is the same at all points.
5. At points on a line perpendicular to the direction of motion of q (as in Fig. 33-3a) or equivalently on circles of increasing radius drawn around the line of motion, we find that the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{B}$ decreases like $1/r^2$, where r is the distance from q to the observation point.

The simplest way of defining $\overrightarrow{B}$ that is consistent with these observations is illustrated in Fig. 33-4. At an arbitrary point P (the point at which we wish to find the magnetic field), $\overrightarrow{B}$ is perpendicular to the plane determined by $\vec{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$ (the vector that locates P relative to q). We know from our observations that the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{B}$ is directly proportional to q, v and sin ϕ and inversely proportional to $r^{2}$:
$$B \propto \frac{q v sin \phi}{r^{2}} . (33-1)$$

The direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$ relative to $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$ reminds us of the rule for finding a vector (cross) product. In the expression $\overrightarrow{c}=\overrightarrow{a} ×\overrightarrow{b}$, the vector $\overrightarrow{c}$ is perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. We can therefore write Eq. 33-1 in vector form as:
$$\vec{B}=K \frac{q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}, \quad(33-2)$$
where K is a constant of proportionality to be determined. Here $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\overrightarrow{r}$. (You may wish to review Section 25-4, where we used a similar unit vector notation to express Coulomb’s law.) Because $\hat{r}=\overrightarrow{r} / r$, we can write Eq. 33-2 as:
$$\vec{B}=K \frac{q \vec{v} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-3)$$

Even though there is a factor of $r^{3}$ in the denominator, the field varies as $1/r^2$ because there is also a factor of r in the numerator.

All that remains to obtain the complete expression for the magnetic field of a moving charge is to determine the constant of proportionality in Eq. 33-3, just as we inserted the constant $1 / 4 \pi \epsilon_{0}$ into Coulomb's law. The constants in the magnetic and electric field equations are not independent quantities; they are related by the speed of light, as we discuss in Chapter 38. Since the speed of light is a defined quantity, our choices are either (1) to use the electric force law (Coulomb's law) to define the electric constant and then use the value of the speed of light to obtain the magnetic constant, or (2) to use a magnetic force law (the force between current-carrying wires, which we discuss later in this chapter) to define the magnetic constant and then use the value of the speed of light to obtain the electric constant. Because the magnetic force between current-carrying wires can be measured more precisely than the electric force between charges, we choose the second method.

The proportionality constant in Eq. 33-3 is defined in SI units to have the exact value $10^{-7}$ tesla-meter/ampere (T·m/A). However, as was the case in electrostatics, we find it convenient to write the constant in a different form:
$$K=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi}=10^{-7} T \cdot m / A .$$

The constant $\mu_{0}$ has historically been known as the permeability constant, but we will refer to it simply as the magnetic constant. It has the exact value:
$$\mu_{0}=4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A .$$

The magnetic constant $\mu_{0}$ plays a role in calculating magnetic fields similar to that of the electric constant $\epsilon_{0}$ in calculating electric fields. The two constants are related through the speed of light: $c=(\epsilon_{0} \mu_{0})^{-1 / 2}$. Defining $\mu_{0}$ and c then determines $\epsilon_{0}$ exactly.

We are now able to write the complete expression for the magnetic field due to a moving charge:
$$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-4)$$

We can write the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{B}$ as:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{|q| v sin \phi}{r^{2}}, (33-5)$$
where ϕ is the angle between $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$.

Based on these thought experiments, we have been able to learn several properties of the magnetic field produced by a moving charge, including the important geometrical relationship between the direction of the velocity and the direction of the field. It will now be trivial to transfer this relationship to the more useful case of the magnetic field produced by currents in wires.

Why is the magnetic field specified by Eqs. 33-4 or 33-5 not especially useful? When we studied electric fields, our interest was in the steady electric field produced by charges whose locations did not change. We called this subject electrostatics. Now we are interested in magnetostatics—the production of steady magnetic fields by charges whose motion does not change. The single moving charge of Fig. 33-4 does not satisfy this criterion; an instant after the situation illustrated in the figure, the charge is at a different location with respect to point P and there is no charge at all at its previous location. An instant later there will be a different magnetic field at P. To maintain a steady magnetic field at P due to a moving charge at the exact location shown, it would be necessary to arrange to destroy the charge as soon as it left that location and to inject a new charge into that location with the same velocity, a highly improbable scenario. On the other hand, a steady current accomplishes exactly what we want: an unchanging motion of charges that produces a steady magnetic field. In the next section we adapt Eqs. 33-4 and 33-5 to the case of steady currents.

### 33-1 运动电荷产生的磁场（中文翻译）
在上一章中，我们讨论了带电粒子在磁场中运动时所受的力。与电场类似——静止的带电粒子既是电场的源，也是探测电场的探针——我们可以推测，已被证明是磁场探针的运动电荷，也可以作为磁场的源。

这一推测于1820年由汉斯·克里斯蒂安·奥斯特*首次通过实验证实。如图33-1所示，他观察到：当指南针靠近通有电流的直导线时，磁针会调整方向，使其与围绕导线绘制的圆相切（忽略地球磁场对指南针的影响）。奥斯特的发现建立了电与磁之间的第一个联系。

直到1876年，亨利·罗兰**的实验才提供了运动电荷产生磁场的直接实验证据。罗兰实验的示意图如图33-2所示。他制备了一个带电圆盘（通过将电池连接到沉积在绝缘圆盘表面的金层上），通过使圆盘绕其轴旋转产生运动电荷，并通过在圆盘附近悬挂磁化磁针来展示其磁效应。

本章的目的是研究两个运动电荷之间的磁相互作用，就像库仑研究静止电荷之间的电相互作用那样。库仑能够直接测量静电力，原则上我们也应该能够做到这一点——即测量两个运动电荷之间的磁力。遗憾的是，这种力极其微弱，难以测量；例如在罗兰的实验中，旋转带电圆盘产生的磁场仅为地球磁场的0.00001倍！

尽管单个运动电荷产生的磁场极其微弱，但从概念上讲，我们最好先讨论单个运动电荷如何产生磁场，再开始研究磁场的源。稍后我们将看到为什么这种方法不实用，以及为什么在实验室中通过导线中的电流（即运动电荷的集合形式）产生磁场更为简便。

因此，我们进行一个“思想实验”：发射一个速度为$\vec{v}$的单个电荷q，并用一个可自由调整方向的悬挂磁针探测磁场。为避免相对论效应带来的问题，我们需确保粒子在我们的参考系中的速度远小于光速。实验在地球磁场可忽略的区域进行（无需前往外太空，实验室中可通过载流线圈产生抵消地球磁场的磁场）。图33-3a展示了不同位置的磁场测量结果：运动电荷会产生磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$，磁针会指示任意位置的磁场方向。原则上，我们还可以通过测量第二个运动带电粒子所受的力（如第32-2节所述）来确定磁场的大小。

如果能实际进行这些实验，我们会发现运动电荷产生的磁场具有以下特性：
1. 磁场强度与速度大小和电荷q均成正比。
2. 若$\overrightarrow{v}$反向或q改变符号，则$\overrightarrow{B}$的方向也会反向。
3. 在沿$\vec{v}$方向的点（包括正向和反向），磁场为零；在其他相对于$\vec{v}$的方向上（如图33-3a所示），磁场随sinϕ变化。
4. $\overrightarrow{B}$与垂直于$\vec{v}$的平面内以$\vec{v}$为中心绘制的圆相切，其方向由右手定则确定（拇指指向$\vec{v}$方向，四指弯曲方向即为$\overrightarrow{B}$的方向）；在同一圆周上，各点的$\overrightarrow{B}$大小相等。
5. 在垂直于q运动方向的直线上（如图33-3a所示），或等效地在围绕运动轨迹绘制的半径递增的圆上，$\overrightarrow{B}$的大小随$1/r^2$减小（r为电荷q到观测点的距离）。

与这些观测结果一致的$\overrightarrow{B}$的最简定义如图33-4所示。在任意观测点P，$\overrightarrow{B}$垂直于由$\vec{v}$和$\overrightarrow{r}$（从q指向P的矢量）所确定的平面。由观测结果可知，$\overrightarrow{B}$的大小与q、v、sinϕ成正比，与$r^2$成反比：
$$B \propto \frac{q v sin \phi}{r^{2}} . (33-1)$$

$\overrightarrow{B}$相对于$\overrightarrow{v}$和$\overrightarrow{r}$的方向关系，与矢量叉乘的规则相似。在表达式$\overrightarrow{c}=\overrightarrow{a} ×\overrightarrow{b}$中，$\overrightarrow{c}$垂直于$\overrightarrow{a}$和$\overrightarrow{b}$所确定的平面。因此，我们可将式（33-1）写成矢量形式：
$$\vec{B}=K \frac{q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}, \quad(33-2)$$
其中K为待确定的比例常数，$\hat{r}$是沿$\overrightarrow{r}$方向的单位矢量（可回顾第25-4节，我们曾用类似的单位矢量符号表示库仑定律）。由于$\hat{r}=\overrightarrow{r}/r$，式（33-2）可改写为：
$$\vec{B}=K \frac{q \vec{v} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-3)$$

尽管分母中存在$r^3$项，但由于分子中也有一个r因子，磁场仍随$1/r^2$变化。

要得到运动电荷磁场的完整表达式，只需确定式（33-3）中的比例常数，就像我们在库仑定律中引入常数$1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$那样。磁场和电场方程中的常数并非相互独立，它们通过光速关联（将在第38章讨论）。由于光速是一个定义量，我们有两种选择：（1）利用电力定律（库仑定律）定义电常数，再通过光速确定磁常数；（2）利用磁力定律（本章后续将讨论的载流导线间的作用力）定义磁常数，再通过光速确定电常数。由于载流导线间的磁力比电荷间的电力测量更精确，我们选择第二种方法。

在国际单位制中，式（33-3）中的比例常数被定义为精确值$10^{-7}$特斯拉·米/安培（T·m/A）。但与静电学类似，我们更方便将其表示为以下形式：
$$K=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi}=10^{-7} T \cdot m / A .$$

常数$\mu_0$历史上被称为磁导率常数，此处我们简称为磁常数，其精确值为：
$$\mu_{0}=4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A .$$

磁常数$\mu_0$在磁场计算中的作用，类似于电常数$\epsilon_0$在电场计算中的作用。两者通过光速关联：$c=(\epsilon_0\mu_0)^{-1/2}$。定义$\mu_0$和c后，即可精确确定$\epsilon_0$。

现在我们可以写出运动电荷产生磁场的完整表达式：
$$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-4)$$

$\overrightarrow{B}$的大小为：
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{|q| v sin \phi}{r^{2}}, (33-5)$$
其中ϕ为$\overrightarrow{v}$与$\overrightarrow{r}$之间的夹角。

通过这些思想实验，我们已经了解了运动电荷产生磁场的若干特性，包括速度方向与磁场方向之间重要的几何关系。接下来，将这一关系推广到更实用的载流导线产生磁场的情况将非常简单。

为什么式（33-4）或（33-5）所描述的磁场并不特别实用？在研究电场时，我们关注的是由位置不变的电荷产生的恒定电场（静电学）。现在我们关注静磁学——由运动状态不变的电荷产生的恒定磁场。图33-4中的单个运动电荷不满足这一条件：在图示状态的瞬间之后，电荷相对于P点的位置会发生变化，其原位置将不再有电荷，P点的磁场也会随之改变。要使P点的磁场保持恒定，需在电荷离开原位置时立即将其“销毁”，并在该位置注入一个速度相同的新电荷，这在实际中几乎不可能实现。而恒定电流恰好能满足我们的需求：电荷的运动状态不变，从而产生恒定的磁场。下一节我们将把式（33-4）和（33-5）推广到恒定电流的情况。

### 33-2 THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A CURRENT（英文原文）
In the laboratory we produce magnetic fields using current-carrying wires rather than the motion of individual charges. In this section we extend the results of the previous section to permit us to find the magnetic field due to a current. Our strategy is first to find the field due to the current in a short element of the wire, and then to use integration methods to find the field due to the current in the entire wire.

This method is similar to the one we used in Section 26-4 to find the electric field due to a continuous charge distribution. In Chapter 26, we began with the electric field due to a point charge, which we can write as $\overrightarrow{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$. To find the electric field due to a continuous charge distribution, we imagined the object to be composed of infinitesimal elements of charge $d q$, each of which could be treated as a point charge in calculating its contribution $d \overrightarrow{E}$ to the electric field: $d \overrightarrow{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{d q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$. The total electric field is found by adding the contributions of all the charge elements: $\overrightarrow{E}=\int d \overrightarrow{E}$, which is a shorthand way of representing the total field of each of the vector components: $E_{x}=\int d E_{x}$ and so forth.

How do we represent an increment of current in the analogous calculation of the magnetic field? For a clue about how to proceed, we can review the relationship from the previous chapter between the magnetic force exerted on an individual moving charge, $\overrightarrow{F}_{B}=q \overrightarrow{v} ×\overrightarrow{B}$ (Eq.32-3), and the magnetic force exerted on a current element, $d \overrightarrow{F}_{B}=i d \overrightarrow{L} ×\overrightarrow{B}$ (Eq.32-29). In this equation, $d \overrightarrow{L}$ is a vector whose length is equal to the length of the element of the wire and whose direction is the direction of the current in that element. That is, we can go from an expression describing the force on an individual moving charge to one describing the force on a current element by replacing $q \overrightarrow{v}$ by $i d \overrightarrow{L}$.

We can modify Eq. 33-4 in exactly the same way. We seek the contribution $d \overrightarrow{B}$ to the magnetic field due to a current element, which we can consider to be represented by a charge element $d q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$:
$$d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{d q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}} . (33-6)$$

We can write the velocity as $\vec{v}=\frac{d \vec{s}}{d t}$ so that the charge $d q$ moves through the displacement $d \overrightarrow{s}$ in the time interval $d t$. We now have:
$$d q \vec{v}=d q \frac{d \vec{s}}{d t}=\frac{d q}{d t} d \vec{s}=i d \vec{s} . (33-7)$$

Substituting Eq. 33-7 into Eq. 33-6, we obtain:
$$d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d \vec{s} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d \vec{s} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-8)$$

This expression is known as the Biot—Savart law. The direction of $d \overrightarrow{B}$ is the same as the direction of $d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$. The magnitude of the field element $d \overrightarrow{B}$ is:
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d s sin \phi}{r^{2}}, (33-9)$$
where $\phi$ is the angle between the vector $d \overrightarrow{s}$, which indicates the direction of the current, and the vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ from the current element to the observation point P. Figure 33-6 shows the vector relationships; compare with Fig. 33-4 and note how similar the two figures are.

To find the total field $\overrightarrow{B}$ due to the entire current distribution, we must integrate over all current elements $i d \overrightarrow{s}$:
$$\vec{B}=\int d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int \frac{i d \vec{s} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int \frac{i d \vec{s} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} .$$

Just as we did in Chapter 26 for electric fields, we will in general have to take into account in computing this integral that not all of the elements of $d \overrightarrow{B}$ are in the same direction; see Section 26-4.

We now consider how to apply the Biot—Savart law to calculate the magnetic fields of some current-carrying wires of different shapes.

#### A Straight Wire Segment
We illustrate the use of the Biot—Savart law by applying it to the calculation of the magnetic field due to a current $i$ in a straight wire segment of length $L$. Figure 33-7 shows the geometry. The wire lies along the z axis, and we want to find $\overrightarrow{B}$ at point P on the y axis, a distance $d$ from the wire. The center of the wire is at the origin, so P is on the perpendicular bisector of the wire. The first step in the calculation is to choose an arbitrary element of the wire $i d \overrightarrow{s}$, which is located at coordinate $z$ relative to the origin. The contribution $d \overrightarrow{B}$ of this element to the field at P is given by Eq. 33-8 and involves the vector cross product $d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$. Using the right-hand rule we can show that, in the geometry of Fig. 33-7, $d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$ is a vector that points in the negative x direction, and we see that this is true no matter where on the wire we choose the current element. Every element of the wire gives a $d \overrightarrow{B}$ in the negative x direction, and therefore when we add up all the elements $d \overrightarrow{B}$ we will find that the total field is in the negative x direction. Since we have now obtained the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$, we can turn to finding its magnitude using Eq. 33-9.

With $d \overrightarrow{s}$ in the z direction we have $d s=d z$, and $z$ will be our variable of integration, ranging from $-L / 2$ to $+L/2$. To integrate Eq. 33-9, we must first express $\phi$ and $r$ in terms of the integration variable $z$:
$$r=\sqrt{z^{2}+d^{2}}$$
and
$$sin \phi=sin (\pi-\phi)=\frac{d}{\sqrt{z^{2}+d^{2}}} .$$

Making these substitutions into Eq. 33-9, we obtain:
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d z sin \phi}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} d z . (33-11)$$

Carrying out the integral, we find the total field:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i d}{4 \pi} \int_{-L / 2}^{+L / 2} \frac{d z}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}=\left.\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi d} \frac{z}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}}\right|_{z=-L / 2} ^{z=+L / 2}$$
or
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi d} \frac{L}{\left(L^{2} / 4+d^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}} . (33-12)$$

In the limit of a very long wire (that is, $L \gg d$), Eq.33-12 becomes:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi d} . (33-13)$$

This problem reminds us of its electrostatic equivalent. We derived an expression for $\overrightarrow{E}$ due to a long charged rod by integration methods, using Coulomb's law (Section 26-4). We also solved the same problem using Gauss’ law (Section 27-5). Later we consider a law of magnetic fields, Ampère’s law, which is similar to Gauss’ law in that it simplifies magnetic field calculations in cases (such as this one) that have a high degree of symmetry.

Just as we did for electric fields, we can represent the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire by magnetic field lines. Figure 33-8 shows a set of magnetic field lines for a long, straight wire. The field lines form concentric circles around the wire, as suggested by Oersted’s experiment (Fig. 33-1) and as also indicated by the pattern of iron filings near a wire (Fig. 33-9).

At any point, the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$ is tangent to the field line at that point. The field is large where the field lines are close together (such as near the wire) and small where the field lines are farther apart (far from the wire). Contrary to electric field lines due to charges, which begin on positive charges and end on negative charges, the magnetic field lines due to currents form continuous loops with no beginning or end. To find the direction of the field lines, we use the right-hand rule: if you were to grasp the wire in your right hand with your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers would curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.

#### A Circular Current Loop
Figure 33-10 shows a circular loop of radius $R$ carrying a current $i$. Let us calculate $\overrightarrow{B}$ at a point P on the axis a distance $z$ from the center of the loop.

The angle between the current element $i d \overrightarrow{s}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$ is 90°. From the Biot—Savart law, we know that the vector $d \overrightarrow{B}$ for this element is at right angles to the plane formed by $i d \overrightarrow{s}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$ and thus lies at right angles to $\overrightarrow{r}$, as the figure shows.

Let us resolve $d \overrightarrow{B}$ into two components; one, $d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$, along the axis of the loop and another, $d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$, at right angles to the axis. Only $d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$ contributes to the total magnetic field at point P. This follows because the components $d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$ for all current elements lie on the axis and add directly; however, the components $d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$ point in different directions perpendicular to the axis, and the sum of all $d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$ for the complete loop is zero, from symmetry. (A diametrically opposite current element, indicated in Fig. 33-10, produces the same magnitude of $d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$ but the opposite direction of $d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$.) We can therefore replace the vector integral over all $d \overrightarrow{B}$ with an integral over the $z$ components only, and the magnitude of the field is given by:
$$d B_{z}=d B cos \alpha,$$
(33-14)

For the current element in Fig. 33-10, the Biot—Savart law (Eq. 33-9) gives:
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d s sin 90^{\circ}}{r^{2}} . \quad(33-15)$$

We also have:
$$r=\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}$$
(33-16)
which, combined with Eq. 33-15, gives:
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d s}{\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)} .$$

and
$$cos \alpha=\frac{R}{r}=\frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}} .$$
(33-17)

Substituting these values into the expression for $d B_{z}$ gives:
$$d B_{z}=\frac{\mu_{0} i R}{4 \pi\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} d s . \quad(33-18)$$

Note that $i$, $R$, and $z$ have the same values for all current elements. Integrating this equation, we obtain:
$$B=\int d B_{z}=\frac{\mu_{0} i R}{4 \pi\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \int d s \quad(33-19)$$
or, noting that $\int d s$ is simply the circumference of the loop (=2πR),
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i R^{2}}{2\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} . (33-20)$$

We can repeat the above calculation to find the field at the center of the loop. In this case $z=0$ (so $r=R$ everywhere), and the Biot—Savart law gives:
$$B=\int d B_{z}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi R^{2}} \int d s . (33-21)$$

If we integrate around the circle, the integral $\int d s=2\pi R$, so:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 R} . (33-22)$$
which we could have obtained by setting $z=0$ in Eq.33-20. However, we can use this method to obtain a more general result when the current flows not in a complete circle but in an arc of a circle. Suppose the arc subtends an angle $\theta$ at its center. Then in Eq. 33-21, the integral $\int d s$ gives not the full circumference of the circle but only the arc length $R \theta$ (which is equal to $2 \pi R$ when $\theta=2 \pi$). The field at the center of the arc is then:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i \theta}{4 \pi R} . (33-23)$$

The angle $\theta$ must be expressed in radians in this equation. The right-hand rule again gives the direction of the magnetic field, which is along the z axis.

If $z \gg R$ so that points close to the loop are not considered, Eq. 33-20 becomes:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i R^{2}}{2 z^{3}} . (33-24)$$

This dependence of the field on the inverse cube of the distance reminds us of the electric field of an electric dipole (see Eq. 26-12 and also see Problem 1 of Chapter 26 for the field on the dipole axis). It is often convenient to consider a loop of wire to be a magnetic dipole. Just as the electric behavior of many molecules can be characterized in terms of their electric dipole moment, so also the magnetic behavior of atoms can be described in terms of their magnetic dipole moment. In the case of atoms, the current loop is due to the circulation of electrons about the nucleus. We discuss the magnetic dipole moments of atoms in Chapter 35.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-2
In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the electron circulates around the nucleus in a circular path of radius $5.29 ×10^{-11} ~m$ at a frequency $f$ of $6.60 × 10^{15}$ Hz (or rev/s). What value of $B$ is set up at the center of the orbit?

**Solution**  
The current is the rate at which charge passes any point on the orbit and is given by:
$$i=q f=\left(1.60 × 10^{-19} C\right)\left(6.60 × 10^{15} Hz\right)=1.06 × 10^{-3} A .$$
(33-25)

The magnetic field $B$ at the center of the orbit is given by Eq. 33-22:
$$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 R}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)\left(1.06 × 10^{-3} A\right)}{2\left(5.29 × 10^{-11} m\right)}=12.6 T .$$
(33-26)


### 33-2 电流产生的磁场（中文翻译）
在实验室中，我们通常利用载流导线产生磁场，而非单个电荷的运动。本节将基于上一节的结论进行推广，以求解电流产生的磁场。我们的思路是：先求出导线中一小段电流元产生的磁场，再通过积分法求出整个导线中电流产生的总磁场。

这种方法与第26-4节中求解连续电荷分布产生电场的方法类似。在第26章中，我们从点电荷的电场公式（$\overrightarrow{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$）出发，求解连续电荷分布的电场：将带电体分解为无数个电荷元$d q$，每个电荷元均可视为点电荷，其产生的电场元为$d \overrightarrow{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{d q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$；总电场则是所有电荷元电场的矢量和，即$\overrightarrow{E}=\int d \overrightarrow{E}$（该式为矢量积分的简写，实际计算时需分解为分量积分，如$E_{x}=\int d E_{x}$等）。

在类似的磁场计算中，如何表示电流元呢？我们可回顾上一章中“单个运动电荷所受磁力”与“电流元所受磁力”的关系：单个运动电荷的磁力为$\overrightarrow{F}_{B}=q \overrightarrow{v} ×\overrightarrow{B}$（式32-3），电流元的磁力为$d \overrightarrow{F}_{B}=i d \overrightarrow{L} ×\overrightarrow{B}$（式32-29）。式中$d \overrightarrow{L}$是电流元矢量，其大小等于电流元的长度，方向与电流方向一致。由此可见，将“单个运动电荷的受力公式”推广为“电流元的受力公式”，只需将$q \overrightarrow{v}$替换为$i d \overrightarrow{L}$。

我们采用完全相同的方法修改式（33-4），以求解电流元产生的磁场元$d \overrightarrow{B}$。电流元可视为“以速度$\vec{v}$运动的电荷元$d q$”，其产生的磁场元为：
$$d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{d q \vec{v} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}} . (33-6)$$

由于速度$\vec{v}=\frac{d \vec{s}}{d t}$（电荷元$d q$在时间$d t$内移动的位移为$d \overrightarrow{s}$），因此：
$$d q \vec{v}=d q \frac{d \vec{s}}{d t}=\frac{d q}{d t} d \vec{s}=i d \vec{s} . (33-7)$$

将式（33-7）代入式（33-6），可得：
$$d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d \vec{s} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d \vec{s} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} . (33-8)$$

该式即为**毕奥-萨伐尔定律**。磁场元$d \overrightarrow{B}$的方向与$d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$的方向一致，其大小为：
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d s sin \phi}{r^{2}}, (33-9)$$
其中$\phi$是电流元矢量$d \overrightarrow{s}$（方向与电流一致）与“电流元到观测点P的矢量$\overrightarrow{r}$”之间的夹角。图33-6展示了各矢量的关系，可与图33-4对比，二者具有高度相似性。

要计算整个电流分布产生的总磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$，需对所有电流元$i d \overrightarrow{s}$的磁场元进行积分：
$$\vec{B}=\int d \vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int \frac{i d \vec{s} × \hat{r}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int \frac{i d \vec{s} × \vec{r}}{r^{3}} .$$

与第26章计算电场类似，由于不同电流元的$d \overrightarrow{B}$方向可能不同，积分时需考虑矢量方向的影响（详见第26-4节）。

下面我们将应用毕奥-萨伐尔定律，计算几种不同形状载流导线产生的磁场。

#### 1. 直导线段
以“长度为$L$、通有电流$i$的直导线段”为例，说明毕奥-萨伐尔定律的应用。如图33-7所示，导线沿z轴放置，观测点P位于y轴上，与导线的距离为$d$；导线中点在坐标原点，因此P在导线的垂直平分线上。计算步骤如下：

1. **选取电流元与磁场元方向**：取导线上任意电流元$i d \overrightarrow{s}$，其坐标为$z$（以原点为参考）。根据式（33-8），该电流元产生的磁场元$d \overrightarrow{B}$由叉乘$d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$决定。由右手定则可知，在图33-7的几何关系中，$d \overrightarrow{s} ×\overrightarrow{r}$的方向始终沿-x方向，因此所有电流元的$d \overrightarrow{B}$均沿-x方向，总磁场方向也为-x方向。

2. **积分变量与表达式替换**：由于$d \overrightarrow{s}$沿z轴，可取$d s=d z$，积分变量为$z$，积分范围为$-L/2$到$+L/2$。为积分式（33-9），需将$\phi$和$r$用$z$表示：
   $$r=\sqrt{z^{2}+d^{2}}$$
   $$sin \phi=sin (\pi-\phi)=\frac{d}{\sqrt{z^{2}+d^{2}}} .$$

3. **积分求解总磁场**：将上述关系代入式（33-9），得磁场元大小：
   $$d B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d z sin \phi}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} d z . (33-11)$$

   对$z$积分可得总磁场大小：
   $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i d}{4 \pi} \int_{-L / 2}^{+L / 2} \frac{d z}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}=\left.\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi d} \frac{z}{\left(z^{2}+d^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}}\right|_{z=-L / 2} ^{z=+L / 2}$$
   化简后：
   $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi d} \frac{L}{\left(L^{2} / 4+d^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}} . (33-12)$$

4. **无限长直导线的极限情况**：当导线极长（$L \gg d$）时，式（33-12）可简化为：
   $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi d} . (33-13)$$

该问题与静电学中“无限长带电细杆的电场”具有类比性：我们曾用积分法（基于库仑定律，第26-4节）和高斯定律（第27-5节）两种方法求解带电细杆的电场。后续将介绍磁场中的“安培定律”，它与高斯定律类似，可简化具有高度对称性的磁场计算（如无限长直导线的磁场）。

与电场类似，载流导线的磁场也可用**磁场线**表示。图33-8为无限长直导线的磁场线：磁场线是以导线为中心的同心圆，这与奥斯特实验（图33-1）的结论一致，也可通过导线附近铁粉的分布（图33-9）观察到。

磁场线的特性如下：
- 任意点的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$方向与该点磁场线相切；
- 磁场线密集处（如导线附近）磁场强，稀疏处（远离导线）磁场弱；
- 与“始于正电荷、止于负电荷”的电场线不同，电流产生的磁场线是无始无终的闭合曲线；
- 磁场线方向由右手定则判断：右手握住导线，拇指指向电流方向，四指弯曲方向即为磁场线方向。

#### 2. 圆形电流环
如图33-10所示，半径为$R$的圆形导线环通有电流$i$，我们来计算其轴线上距离环中心为$z$的点P处的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$。

1. **电流元与磁场元的分解**：电流元$i d \overrightarrow{s}$与矢量$\overrightarrow{r}$（电流元到P点）的夹角为90°。根据毕奥-萨伐尔定律，磁场元$d \overrightarrow{B}$垂直于$i d \overrightarrow{s}$与$\overrightarrow{r}$组成的平面，因此也垂直于$\overrightarrow{r}$。将$d \overrightarrow{B}$分解为“沿环轴线的分量$d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$”和“垂直于轴线的分量$d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$”：
   - 所有电流元的$d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$方向一致（沿轴线），可直接叠加；
   - 垂直分量$d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$具有对称性：环上某电流元的$d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$，必存在一个 diametrically opposite（直径相对）的电流元，其$d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$方向相反、大小相等，最终所有$d \overrightarrow{B}_{\perp}$相互抵消。

   因此，总磁场仅由$d \overrightarrow{B}_{z}$决定，其大小为：
   $$d B_{z}=d B cos \alpha,$$
   (33-14)

2. **磁场元大小与几何关系**：由毕奥-萨伐尔定律（式33-9），电流元产生的磁场元大小为：
   $$d B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d s sin 90^{\circ}}{r^{2}}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{4 \pi} \frac{d s}{r^{2}} . \quad(33-15)$$

   由几何关系可知：
   $$r=\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}$$
   (33-16)
   $$cos \alpha=\frac{R}{r}=\frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}} .$$
   (33-17)

3. **积分求解总磁场**：将式（33-15）、（33-17）代入$d B_{z}$的表达式，得：
   $$d B_{z}=\frac{\mu_{0} i R}{4 \pi\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} d s . \quad(33-18)$$

   由于$i$、$R$、$z$对所有电流元均为定值，积分时可提出积分外；$\int d s$为圆环的周长（$2\pi R$），因此：
   $$B=\int d B_{z}=\frac{\mu_{0} i R}{4 \pi\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \times 2\pi R$$
   化简得：
   $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i R^{2}}{2\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} . (33-20)$$

4. **特殊情况**：
   - **环中心的磁场**：当$z=0$（P点在环中心）时，式（33-20）简化为：
     $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 R} . (33-22)$$
   - **圆弧电流的磁场**：若电流仅沿圆心角为$\theta$（弧度制）的圆弧流动，则$\int d s=R\theta$，环中心的磁场为：
     $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i \theta}{4 \pi R} . (33-23)$$
   - **远场情况（$z \gg R$）**：此时式（33-20）可近似为：
     $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i R^{2}}{2 z^{3}} . (33-24)$$

     该式表明，远场中圆形电流环的磁场与距离的三次方成反比，这与电偶极子的电场（见第26-12节）类似。因此，可将圆形电流环视为**磁偶极子**。正如许多分子的电学性质可用电偶极矩描述，原子的磁学性质也可用磁偶极矩描述（原子中的“电流环”源于电子绕核的圆周运动，第35章将讨论原子磁偶极矩）。

#### 例题33-2
在氢原子的玻尔模型中，电子以半径$5.29 ×10^{-11} ~m$的圆形轨道绕核运动，频率$f=6.60 × 10^{15}$ Hz（转/秒）。求轨道中心处的磁感应强度$B$。

**解答**  
1. **计算等效电流**：电流是单位时间内通过轨道任意点的电荷量，即：
   $$i=q f=\left(1.60 × 10^{-19} C\right)\left(6.60 × 10^{15} Hz\right)=1.06 × 10^{-3} A .$$
   (33-25)

2. **计算轨道中心的磁场**：由圆形电流环中心的磁场公式（式33-22）：
   $$B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 R}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)\left(1.06 × 10^{-3} A\right)}{2\left(5.29 × 10^{-11} m\right)}=12.6 T .$$

### 33-3 TWO PARALLEL CURRENTS（英文原文）
In this section we use long wires carrying parallel (or antiparallel) currents to illustrate two properties of magnetic fields: the addition of the fields due to different wires and the force exerted by one wire on another.

First we consider the vector addition of the fields due to two different parallel wires, as shown in Fig. 33-11. Two wires are perpendicular to the plane of the figure, and they carry currents in opposite directions. We wish to find the magnetic field at point P due to the two wires. The magnetic field lines due to wire 1 form concentric circles about that wire, and the magnitude of the field at the distance $r_{1}$ is given by Eq. 33-13, $B=\mu_{0} i_{1} / 2 \pi r_{1}$. The direction of $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ is tangent to the circular arc passing through P, equivalently, is perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{r}_{1}$, the radial vector from the wire to P.

Similarly, the field due to wire 2 is shown in the figure as $\overrightarrow{B}_{2}$ and is tangent to the circular magnetic field lines and perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{r}_{2}$. To find the net field at P we take the vector sum of the fields due to the two individual wires: $\overrightarrow{B}=\overrightarrow{B}_{1}+\overrightarrow{B}_{2}$. The magnitude and direction of the total field can be found using the usual rules for vector addition.

The situation shown in Fig. 33-11 is similar to the method for calculating the total electric field due to two point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$: we find the individual fields at point P due to each charge, and then the vector sum gives the total field, $\overrightarrow{E}=\overrightarrow{E}_{1}+\overrightarrow{E}_{2}$. To observe this total electric field at P we could measure the force on a third charged particle placed at that point. Similarly, to observe the total magnetic field at P in Fig. 33-11, we could measure the force on a charged particle moving through that point or on a third wire carrying a current through P.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-3
In Fig. 33-12, let $i_{1}=15 ~A$ and $i_{2}=32 ~A$. The two wires are separated by a distance $a=5.3 ~cm$. Find the total magnetic field at a point a distance $a/2$ along a line perpendicular to the line connecting the two wires.

**Solution**  
Figure 33-12 shows the geometry and the fields $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}_{2}$. With $d_{1}=d_{2}=a / \sqrt{2}$, the magnitudes of the fields are:
$$B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{1}}{2 \pi d_{1}}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(15 A)}{2 \pi(0.053 m) / \sqrt{2}}=80 \mu T,$$
$$B_{2}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{2}}{2 \pi d_{2}}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(32 A)}{2 \pi(0.053 m) / \sqrt{2}}=171 \mu T .$$

In the special geometry of Fig. 33-12 the two fields are perpendicular, so:
$$B=\sqrt{B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}^{2}}=190 \mu T .$$

The angle $\phi$ between $\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}_{2}$ is:
$$\phi=tan ^{-1} \frac{B_{1}}{B_{2}}=25^{\circ},$$
so the angle between $\overrightarrow{B}$ and the horizontal axis is $25^{\circ}+45^{\circ}=70^{\circ}$.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-4
Two long, parallel wires a distance $2 b$ apart carry equal currents $i$ in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 33-13a. Derive an expression for the magnetic field $B$ at a point P on the line connecting the wires and a distance $x$ from the point midway between them.

**Solution**  
Study of Fig. 33-13a shows that $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ due to the current $i_{1}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}_{2}$ due to the current $i_{2}$ point in the same direction at P. Each is given by Eq. 33-13 ($B=\mu_{0} i / 2 \pi d$) so that:
$$B=B_{1}+B_{2}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi(b+x)}+\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi(b-x)}=\frac{\mu_{0} i b}{\pi\left(b^{2}-x^{2}\right)} .$$

Inspection of this result shows that (1) $B$ is symmetrical about $x=0$, (2) $B$ has its minimum value ($=\mu_{0} i / \pi b$) at $x=0$, and (3) $B \to \infty$ as $x \to \pm b$. This last conclusion is not correct, because Eq. 33-13 cannot be applied to points inside the wires. In reality the field due to each wire would vanish at the center of that wire.

You should show that our result for the combined field remains valid at points where $|x| < b$. Figure 33-13b shows the variation of $B$ with $x$ for $i=25 ~A$ and $b=25 ~mm$.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-5
Figure 33-14 shows a flat strip of copper of width $a$ and negligible thickness carrying a current $i$. Find the magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$ at point P, at a distance $R$ from the center of the strip along its perpendicular bisector.

**Solution**  
Let us subdivide the strip into long, infinitesimal filaments of width $dx$, each of which may be treated as a wire carrying a current element $di$ given by $i(dx / a)$. For the current element in the left half of the strip in Fig. 33-14, the magnitude $dB$ of the field at P is given by the differential form of Eq. 33-13, or:
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{d i}{d}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{i(dx / a)}{R sec \theta},$$
in which $d = R / cos \theta = R sec \theta$. Note that the vector $d \overrightarrow{B}$ is at right angles to the line marked $d$.

Only the horizontal component of $d \overrightarrow{B}$ —namely, $dB cos \theta$—is effective; the vertical component is canceled by the contribution of a symmetrically located current element on the other side of the strip (the second shaded element in Fig. 33-14). Thus $B$ at point P is given by the (scalar) integral:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
B&=\int d B cos \theta \\ 
&=\int \frac{\mu_{0} i(dx / a)}{2 \pi R sec \theta} cos \theta \\ 
&=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a R} \int \frac{dx}{sec ^{2} \theta} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The variables $x$ and $\theta$ are not independent, being related by:
$$x=R tan \theta$$
or
$$dx=R sec ^{2} \theta d \theta .$$

The limits on $\theta$ are $\pm \alpha$ where $\alpha=tan ^{-1}(a / 2 R)$. Substituting for $dx$ in the expression for $B$ we find:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
B &= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a R} \int \frac{R sec ^{2} \theta d \theta}{sec ^{2} \theta} \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a} \int_{-\alpha}^{+\alpha} d \theta \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a} \alpha \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a} tan ^{-1} \frac{a}{2 R} . \quad(33-24)
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the general result for the magnetic field due to the strip.

At points far from the strip, $\alpha$ is a small angle, for which $tan \alpha \approx a / 2 R$. Thus we have, as an approximate result:
$$B \approx \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a}\left(\frac{a}{2 R}\right)=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{i}{R} .$$

This result is expected because at distant points the strip cannot be distinguished from a thin wire (see Eq. 33-13).

#### The Interaction between Parallel Currents
We now consider a different calculation involving two long, straight wires carrying parallel (or antiparallel) currents. As a result of the magnetic field due to one wire at the location of the other wire, a magnetic force is exerted on the second wire. Similarly, the second wire sets up a magnetic field at the location of the first wire that exerts a force on that wire.

In Fig. 33-15, wire 1 carrying current $i_{1}$ produces a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ whose magnitude at the location of the second wire is, according to Eq. 33-13:
$$B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{1}}{2 \pi d}$$

The right-hand rule shows that the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ at wire 2 is down, as shown in the figure.

Wire 2, which carries a current $i_{2}$, can thus be considered to be immersed in an external magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$. A length $L$ of this wire experiences a sideways magnetic force $\overrightarrow{F}_{21}=i_{2} \overrightarrow{L} ×\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ of magnitude:
$$F_{21}=i_{2} L B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} L i_{1} i_{2}}{2 \pi d} . (33-25)$$

The vector rule for the cross product shows that $\overrightarrow{F}_{21}$ lies in the plane of the wires and points toward wire 1 in Fig. 33-15.

We could equally well have started with wire 2 by first computing the magnetic field produced by wire 2 at the site of wire 1 and then finding the force $\overrightarrow{F}_{12}$ exerted on a length $L$ of wire 1 by the field of wire 2. This force on wire 1 would, for parallel currents, point toward wire 2 in Fig. 33-15. The forces that the two wires exert on each other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction; they form an action—reaction pair according to Newton's third law.

If the currents in Fig. 33-15 were antiparallel, we would find that the forces on the wires would have the opposite directions: the wires would repel one another. The general rule is:

**Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.**

This rule is in a sense opposite to the rule for electric charges, in that like (parallel) currents attract, but like (same sign) charges repel.

The force between long, parallel wires is used to define the ampere. Given two long, parallel wires of negligible circular cross section separated in vacuum by a distance of 1 meter, the ampere is defined as the current in each wire that would produce a force of $2 ×10^{-7}$ newtons per meter of length.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-6
A long, horizontal, rigidly supported wire carries a current $i_{a}$ of 96 A. Directly above it and parallel to it is a fine wire that carries a current $i_{b}$ of 23 A and weighs 0.073 N/m. How far above the lower wire should this second wire be strung if we hope to support it by magnetic repulsion?

**Solution**  
To provide a repulsion, the two currents must point in opposite directions. For equilibrium, the magnetic force per unit length must equal the weight per unit length and must be oppositely directed. Solving Eq. 33-25 for $d$ yields:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
d&=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{a} i_{b}}{2 \pi(F / L)} \\ 
&=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(96 A)(23 A)}{2 \pi(0.073 N / m)} \\ 
&=6.0 × 10^{-3} m \\ 
&=6.0 mm .
\end{aligned}
$$

We assume that the diameter of the suspended wire is much smaller than the separation of the two wires. This assumption is necessary because in deriving Eq. 33-25 we tacitly assumed that the magnetic field produced by one wire is uniform for all points within the second wire.

Is the equilibrium of the suspended wire stable or unstable against vertical displacements? This can be tested by displacing the wire vertically and examining how the forces on the wire change. Is the equilibrium stable or unstable against horizontal displacements?

Suppose that the fine wire is suspended below the rigidly supported wire. How may it be made to “float”? Is the equilibrium stable or unstable against vertical displacements? Against horizontal displacements?


### 33-3 平行电流（中文翻译）
本节将以通有平行（或反向平行）电流的长直导线为例，介绍磁场的两个特性：不同导线产生磁场的叠加，以及导线之间的相互作用力。

首先考虑两根平行导线产生磁场的矢量叠加，如图33-11所示。两根导线均垂直于纸面，且通有方向相反的电流。我们需要求解这两根导线在P点产生的合磁场。导线1产生的磁场线是以其自身为中心的同心圆，根据式（33-13），在距离导线1为$r_1$处的磁场大小为$B=\mu_0 i_1/(2\pi r_1)$。$\overrightarrow{B}_1$的方向与经过P点的磁场线相切，也即垂直于从导线1指向P点的径向矢量$\overrightarrow{r}_1$。

同理，导线2产生的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_2$（如图所示）也与以导线2为中心的圆形磁场线相切，且垂直于径向矢量$\overrightarrow{r}_2$。P点的合磁场为两根导线各自产生磁场的矢量和，即$\overrightarrow{B}=\overrightarrow{B}_1+\overrightarrow{B}_2$，其大小和方向可通过常规的矢量叠加法则求解。

该场景与“两个点电荷产生电场的叠加”计算方法类似：求解每个点电荷在P点产生的电场后，通过矢量叠加得到总电场$\overrightarrow{E}=\overrightarrow{E}_1+\overrightarrow{E}_2$；若要观测P点的总电场，可通过测量置于P点的第三个带电粒子所受的力实现。与之类似，若要观测图33-11中P点的总磁场，可测量运动带电粒子或通有电流的第三根导线在P点所受的力。

#### 例题33-3
在图33-12中，设$i_1=15\ \text{A}$、$i_2=32\ \text{A}$，两根导线间距$a=5.3\ \text{cm}$。求在“与两导线连线垂直的直线上、距离连线中点$a/2$处”的总磁场。

**解答**  
图33-12展示了该场景的几何关系及磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_1$、$\overrightarrow{B}_2$的方向。由几何关系可知，P点到两根导线的距离均为$d_1=d_2=a/\sqrt{2}$，因此两磁场的大小分别为：
$$B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{1}}{2 \pi d_{1}}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(15 A)}{2 \pi(0.053 m) / \sqrt{2}}=80 \mu T,$$
$$B_{2}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{2}}{2 \pi d_{2}}=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(32 A)}{2 \pi(0.053 m) / \sqrt{2}}=171 \mu T .$$

在图33-12的特殊几何结构中，$\overrightarrow{B}_1$与$\overrightarrow{B}_2$相互垂直，因此合磁场大小为：
$$B=\sqrt{B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}^{2}}=190 \mu T .$$

合磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$与$\overrightarrow{B}_2$的夹角$\phi$满足：
$$\phi=tan ^{-1} \frac{B_{1}}{B_{2}}=25^{\circ},$$
因此合磁场与水平轴的夹角为$25^{\circ}+45^{\circ}=70^{\circ}$。

#### 例题33-4
两根长直平行导线间距为$2b$，通有大小相等、方向相反的电流$i$，如图33-13a所示。推导两导线连线上、距离连线中点为$x$的P点处的磁场表达式。

**解答**  
分析图33-13a可知，导线1产生的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_1$与导线2产生的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_2$在P点方向相同。根据式（33-13）（$B=\mu_0 i/(2\pi d)$），两磁场大小分别为：
$$B_1=\frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi(b+x)},\quad B_2=\frac{\mu_0 i}{2\pi(b-x)}$$
因此合磁场大小为：
$$B=B_{1}+B_{2}=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi(b+x)}+\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi(b-x)}=\frac{\mu_{0} i b}{\pi\left(b^{2}-x^{2}\right)} .$$

对该结果分析可知：（1）磁场$B$关于$x=0$（中点）对称；（2）在$x=0$处，$B$取得最小值$\mu_0 i/(\pi b)$；（3）当$x\to\pm b$时，$B\to\infty$。但最后一个结论并不准确，因为式（33-13）仅适用于导线外部，而导线内部的磁场需重新计算（实际中，每根导线中心处的磁场为零）。

可自行验证，当$|x|<b$（P点在两导线之间）时，上述合磁场表达式均成立。图33-13b展示了当$i=25\ \text{A}$、$b=25\ \text{mm}$时，磁场$B$随$x$的变化关系。

#### 例题33-5
图33-14为一宽度为$a$、厚度可忽略的铜质扁平条带，通有电流$i$。求在条带垂直平分线上、距离条带中心为$R$的P点处的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}$。

**解答**  
将条带分割为无数根宽度为$dx$的细长电流丝，每根电流丝可视为通有电流元$di=i(dx/a)$的细导线。对于图33-14中条带左半部分的某根电流丝，根据式（33-13）的微分形式，其在P点产生的磁场元大小为：
$$d B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{d i}{d}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{i(dx / a)}{R sec \theta},$$
式中$d=R/cos\theta=R sec\theta$（$d$为电流丝到P点的距离）。需注意，磁场元$d\overrightarrow{B}$的方向与$d$的连线垂直。

由于对称性，磁场元$d\overrightarrow{B}$的垂直分量会被条带另一侧对称位置电流丝的垂直分量抵消，仅有水平分量（$dB cos\theta$）对总磁场有贡献（图33-14中阴影部分为对称电流丝）。因此P点的总磁场为水平分量的标量积分：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
B&=\int d B cos \theta \\ 
&=\int \frac{\mu_{0} i(dx / a)}{2 \pi R sec \theta} cos \theta \\ 
&=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a R} \int \frac{dx}{sec ^{2} \theta} .
\end{aligned}
$$

积分变量$x$与$\theta$存在几何关系：
$$x=R tan \theta$$
对其微分得：
$$dx=R sec ^{2} \theta d \theta .$$

积分限为$\theta=\pm\alpha$（其中$\alpha=tan^{-1}(a/(2R))$）。将$dx$代入磁场表达式并积分：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
B &= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a R} \int \frac{R sec ^{2} \theta d \theta}{sec ^{2} \theta} \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi a} \int_{-\alpha}^{+\alpha} d \theta \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a} \alpha \\ 
&= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a} tan ^{-1} \frac{a}{2 R} . \quad(33-24)
\end{aligned}
$$

此式即为扁平条带产生磁场的通用表达式。

当观测点远离条带时，$\alpha$很小，满足$tan\alpha\approx a/(2R)$，此时磁场表达式可近似为：
$$B \approx \frac{\mu_{0} i}{\pi a}\left(\frac{a}{2 R}\right)=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2 \pi} \frac{i}{R} .$$

该结果符合预期：远处观测时，扁平条带与细导线无法区分，其磁场与细导线的磁场公式（式33-13）一致。

#### 平行电流间的相互作用
接下来分析通有平行（或反向平行）电流的两根长直导线之间的作用力：一根导线在另一根导线处产生磁场，从而对另一根导线施加磁力；反之，第二根导线也会在第一根导线处产生磁场并施加反作用力。

如图33-15所示，通有电流$i_1$的导线1在导线2处产生的磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_1$，根据式（33-13），其大小为：
$$B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{1}}{2 \pi d}$$
（$d$为两导线间距）。由右手定则可知，$\overrightarrow{B}_1$在导线2处的方向竖直向下（如图所示）。

通有电流$i_2$的导线2可视为处于外部磁场$\overrightarrow{B}_1$中，根据电流元受力公式$\overrightarrow{F}_{21}=i_2 \overrightarrow{L}×\overrightarrow{B}_1$，长度为$L$的导线2所受磁力大小为：
$$F_{21}=i_{2} L B_{1}=\frac{\mu_{0} L i_{1} i_{2}}{2 \pi d} . (33-25)$$

由叉乘法则可知，$\overrightarrow{F}_{21}$位于两导线所在平面内，且指向导线1（如图33-15所示）。

同理，可先计算导线2在导线1处产生的磁场，再求解长度为$L$的导线1所受的磁力$\overrightarrow{F}_{12}$。对于平行电流，$\overrightarrow{F}_{12}$指向导线2。两导线之间的相互作用力大小相等、方向相反，符合牛顿第三定律的作用-反作用关系。

若两导线通有反向平行电流，上述作用力方向会反向，即两导线相互排斥。由此可总结出通用规律：

**平行电流相互吸引，反向平行电流相互排斥。**

该规律与电荷间的相互作用规律恰好相反：同种（平行）电流相互吸引，而同种（同号）电荷相互排斥。

长直平行导线间的作用力被用于定义“安培”：在真空中，两根横截面可忽略的长直平行导线间距为1米，若每根导线中的电流能使两导线间产生$2×10^{-7}$牛/米的作用力，则该电流大小为1安培。

#### 例题33-6
一根水平放置、固定支撑的长直导线通有电流$i_a=96\ \text{A}$，其正上方有一根平行的细导线，通有电流$i_b=23\ \text{A}$，细导线的重量为0.073牛/米。若希望通过磁斥力使细导线悬浮，细导线应位于下方导线正上方多远处？

**解答**  
要产生磁斥力，两导线的电流方向必须相反。平衡时，细导线单位长度所受的磁斥力需与单位长度的重力大小相等、方向相反。对式（33-25）变形求解间距$d$：
$$
\begin{aligned} 
d&=\frac{\mu_{0} i_{a} i_{b}}{2 \pi(F / L)} \\ 
&=\frac{\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A\right)(96 A)(23 A)}{2 \pi(0.073 N / m)} \\ 
&=6.0 × 10^{-3} m \\ 
&=6.0 mm .
\end{aligned}
$$

计算中假设细导线的直径远小于两导线间距，这一假设是必要的——推导式（33-25）时，我们默认一根导线产生的磁场在另一根导线内部是均匀的。

思考问题：悬浮导线在竖直方向的平衡是稳定平衡还是不稳定平衡？可通过分析“导线竖直位移后受力变化”来判断。水平方向的平衡是稳定还是不稳定？

若将细导线悬挂在固定导线的正下方，如何使其“悬浮”？此时竖直方向与水平方向的平衡分别是稳定还是不稳定？


### 33-4 THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A SOLENOID
Sample Problem 33-5 suggests one way to obtain a uniform magnetic field (that is, a magnetic field that does not vary in either magnitude or direction). A flat strip of conductor, carrying a uniformly distributed current $i$, sets up a magnetic field given by Eq. 33-24. At points very close to the strip (and $tan^{-1} a / 2 R \to \pi / 2$), Eq. 33-24 becomes $B=\mu_{0} i / 2 a$ which is independent of the distance $R$ from the strip. This reminds us of the electric field near a flat plate carrying a uniform charge density, which likewise does not vary in magnitude or direction. In analogy with the parallel-plate capacitor for electric fields, we could create a device with two flat plates carrying equal currents in opposite directions, where the fields would reinforce in the region between the plates and cancel outside the plates.

A more practical way to obtain a nearly uniform magnetic field is to use a solenoid. As indicated in Fig. 33-16a, a solenoid is a helical winding on a cylindrical core. The wires carry a current $i$ and are wound tightly together, so that there are $n$ windings per unit length along the solenoid.

In this section we calculate the field along the central axis of the solenoid using our previous result for the magnetic field of a circular loop of wire. The calculation of the field off the axis is difficult using the Biot—Savart law, but in the next section we discuss a different and much easier way to calculate the field off axis.

Figure 33-16b shows the geometry for calculating the field on the axis. We take the symmetry axis of the solenoid to be the $z$ axis, with the origin at the center of the solenoid. We wish to find the field at point $P$ which is a distance $d$ from the origin along the $z$ axis. We assume that the windings are so narrow that each can be considered as approximately a circular loop of wire, which we assume to be parallel to the $xy$ plane. The solenoid has $N$ turns of wire in a length $L$, so the number of turns per unit length is $n=N / L$.

Consider a thin ring of width $dz$. The number of turns in that ring is $n dz$ and so the total current carried by the ring is $n i dz$ since each turn carries current $i$. The field at $P$ due to this ring is, using Eq. 33-19,
$$
dB=\frac{\mu_{0}(n i dz) R^{2}}{2\left[R^{2}+(z-d)^{2}\right]^{3 / 2}}, \quad(33-26)
$$
where $z$ is the position of the ring relative to point $P$. To find the total field due to all such rings, we integrate this expression from $z=-L / 2$ to $z=+L / 2$. Evaluating the integral (using integral 18 of Appendix I), we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
B &=\frac{\mu_{0} n i R^{2}}{2} \int_{-L / 2}^{+L / 2} \frac{dz}{\left[R^{2}+(z-d)^{2}\right]^{3 / 2}} \\
&=\frac{\mu_{0} n i}{2}\left(\frac{L / 2+d}{\sqrt{R^{2}+(L / 2+d)^{2}}}+\frac{L / 2-d}{\sqrt{R^{2}+(L / 2-d)^{2}}}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression gives us the field on the axis of the solenoid at a distance $d$ from its center. It is valid for points inside as well as outside the solenoid. The direction of the field is determined as usual using the right-hand rule, so that if the current is circulating counterclockwise as viewed from above, the field is in the positive $z$ direction.

In an ideal solenoid, the length $L$ is much greater than the radius $R$. In this case Eq. 33-27 becomes
$$
B=\mu_{0} n i \quad (\text{ideal solenoid}). (33-28)
$$

As we show in the next section, Eq. 33-28 gives the field of an ideal solenoid at all interior points, off axis as well as on axis, and the field is zero at all points outside the interior of the solenoid.

The field calculated from Eq. 33-27 is plotted as a function of location along the axis in Fig. 33-17 for an ideal solenoid and for two different nonideal solenoids. Note that as the solenoid becomes longer and narrower, thus approaching ideal behavior, the field along the axis becomes more nearly constant and drops more rapidly to zero beyond the ends of the solenoid.

We can begin to understand the field in the interior of a solenoid by considering the “stretched-out” solenoid illustrated in Fig. 33-18. Very close to each wire, the magnetic behavior is nearly that of a long, straight wire, with the field lines forming concentric circles around the wire. This field tends to cancel at points between adjacent wires. The figure suggests that the fields from the individual loops of wire combine to form field lines that are roughly parallel to the solenoid axis in its interior. In the limiting case of the ideal solenoid, the field becomes uniform and parallel to the axis.

At exterior points, such as point $P$ in Fig. 33-18, the field due to the upper part of the solenoid turns (marked $\odot$, because the current is out of the page) points to the left and tends to cancel the field due to the lower parts of the solenoid turns (marked $\otimes$, because the current is into the page), which points to the right near $P$. In the limiting case of the ideal solenoid, the field outside the solenoid is zero. Taking the external field to be zero is a good approximation for a real solenoid if its length is much greater than its radius and if we consider only external points such as $P$. Figure 33-19 shows the magnetic field lines for a nonideal solenoid. You can see from the spacing of the field lines that the field exterior to the solenoid is much weaker than the field in the interior, which is very nearly uniform over the cross section of the solenoid.

The solenoid is for magnetic fields what the parallel-plate capacitor is for electric fields: a relatively simple device capable of producing a field that is approximately uniform. In a parallel-plate capacitor, the electric field is nearly uniform if the plate separation is small compared with the dimensions of the plates, and if we are not too close to the edge of the capacitor. In the solenoid, the magnetic field is nearly uniform if the radius is small compared with the length and if we are not too close to the ends. As shown in Fig. 33-17, even for a length that is only 10 times the radius, the magnetic field is within a few percent of the field of the ideal solenoid over the central half of the device.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM 33-7
A solenoid has a length $L=1.23 \, \text{m}$ and an inner diameter $d=3.55 \, \text{cm}$. It has five layers of windings of 850 turns each and carries a current $i=5.57 \, \text{A}$. What is $B$ at its center?

**Solution** With $L / R=69$ we are safe in regarding this as a nearly ideal solenoid. From Eq. 33-28 we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
B&=\mu_{0} n i \\
&=\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}\right)\left(\frac{5 × 850 \, \text{turns}}{1.23 \, \text{m}}\right)(5.57 \, \text{A}) \\
&=2.42 × 10^{-2} \, \text{T}=24.2 \, \text{mT} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that Eq. 33-28 applies even if the solenoid has more than one layer of windings because the diameter of the windings does not enter into the equation.


### 33-4 螺线管的磁场
例题33-5给出了一种获得均匀磁场（即大小和方向均不变化的磁场）的方法：通有均匀分布电流$i$的扁平导体条，其产生的磁场可由式33-24描述。在非常靠近导体条的位置（且$tan^{-1} \frac{a}{2R} \to \frac{\pi}{2}$），式33-24简化为$B=\frac{\mu_0 i}{2a}$，该式表明磁场大小与到导体条的距离$R$无关。这与均匀带电平板附近的电场类似——后者的大小同样与到平板的距离无关。类比电场中的平行板电容器，我们可构造一个由两块平行平板组成的装置：两平板通有大小相等、方向相反的电流，两板之间的磁场会相互加强，而板外的磁场则相互抵消。

不过，获得近均匀磁场更实用的装置是螺线管。如图33-16a所示，螺线管是在圆柱形铁芯上绕制的螺旋形线圈，导线中通有电流$i$，且绕制紧密，沿螺线管轴线方向单位长度的匝数为$n$。

本节将利用此前得到的圆形电流环磁场公式，计算螺线管中心轴线上的磁场。利用毕奥-萨伐尔定律计算螺线管轴外磁场较为复杂，下一节将介绍一种更简便的轴外磁场计算方法。

图33-16b展示了计算轴线上磁场的几何关系：取螺线管的对称轴为$z$轴，原点位于螺线管中心，需计算轴上距离原点$d$处的点$P$的磁场。假设螺线管的每一圈绕组都非常窄，可近似视为平行于$xy$平面的圆形电流环。若螺线管总长度为$L$、总匝数为$N$，则单位长度匝数$n=\frac{N}{L}$。

考虑一个宽度为$dz$的薄圆环，该圆环的匝数为$n dz$。由于每匝线圈通有电流$i$，圆环的总电流为$n i dz$。根据式33-19（圆形电流环的磁场公式），该圆环在点$P$产生的磁场为：
$$
dB=\frac{\mu_{0}(n i dz) R^{2}}{2\left[R^{2}+(z-d)^{2}\right]^{3 / 2}}, \quad(33-26)
$$
其中$z$是圆环相对于点$P$的位置坐标。为求所有此类薄圆环在点$P$产生的总磁场，需将上式从$z=-\frac{L}{2}$到$z=+\frac{L}{2}$积分（积分过程可参考附录I中的积分公式18），最终得到：
$$
\begin{aligned}
B &=\frac{\mu_{0} n i R^{2}}{2} \int_{-L / 2}^{+L / 2} \frac{dz}{\left[R^{2}+(z-d)^{2}\right]^{3 / 2}} \\
&=\frac{\mu_{0} n i}{2}\left(\frac{\frac{L}{2}+d}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(\frac{L}{2}+d\right)^{2}}}+\frac{\frac{L}{2}-d}{\sqrt{R^{2}+\left(\frac{L}{2}-d\right)^{2}}}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

该式给出了螺线管轴线上距离中心$d$处的磁场大小，对螺线管内部和外部的点均适用。磁场方向由右手定则判断：若从螺线管上方观察，电流沿逆时针方向环绕，则磁场沿$z$轴正方向。

对于理想螺线管（长度$L$远大于半径$R$），式33-27可简化为：
$$
B=\mu_{0} n i \quad (\text{理想螺线管}). (33-28)
$$

下一节将证明，式33-28适用于理想螺线管内部所有点（包括轴外点），且理想螺线管外部所有点的磁场均为零。

图33-17绘制了理想螺线管与两种非理想螺线管的轴线上磁场随位置的变化曲线。可见，当螺线管越长、横截面越窄（越接近理想情况）时，轴线上的磁场越接近恒定，且在螺线管两端以外区域，磁场会更快地衰减至零。

通过分析图33-18中“展开的”螺线管，可初步理解其内部磁场的形成：在每根导线附近，磁场行为与长直导线类似，磁场线是以导线为中心的同心圆；而在相邻导线之间的区域，这类磁场会相互抵消。图中还可看出，各圆形电流环产生的磁场会叠加，在螺线管内部形成大致平行于轴线的磁场线。对于理想螺线管，内部磁场最终成为均匀且平行于轴线的磁场。

在螺线管外部点（如图33-18中的点$P$），螺线管上部绕组（标记为$\odot$，表示电流垂直纸面向外）产生的磁场向左，而下部绕组（标记为$\otimes$，表示电流垂直纸面向里）在点$P$附近产生的磁场向右，两者倾向于相互抵消。对于理想螺线管，外部磁场完全为零。对于实际螺线管，若其长度远大于半径，且仅考虑类似点$P$的外部点，将外部磁场视为零是很好的近似。图33-19展示了非理想螺线管的磁场线：从磁场线的疏密程度可看出，螺线管外部的磁场远弱于内部磁场，且内部磁场在横截面上非常接近均匀。

螺线管之于磁场，正如平行板电容器之于电场——两者都是能产生近似均匀场的相对简单的装置。在平行板电容器中，当极板间距远小于极板尺寸，且远离极板边缘时，电场近似均匀；而在螺线管中，当半径远小于长度，且远离两端时，磁场近似均匀。如图33-17所示，即使螺线管长度仅为半径的10倍，在其中心一半区域内，磁场大小与理想螺线管的磁场大小也仅相差百分之几。

#### 例题33-7
某螺线管的长度$L=1.23 \, \text{m}$、内直径$d=3.55 \, \text{cm}$，共绕有5层线圈，每层850匝，通有电流$i=5.57 \, \text{A}$。求其中心处的磁场大小$B$。

**解答** 由于$\frac{L}{R}=69$（$R$为螺线管内半径），可将该螺线管视为近理想螺线管。根据式33-28可得：
$$
\begin{aligned}
B&=\mu_{0} n i \\
&=\left(4 \pi × 10^{-7} \, \text{特·米/安}\right)\left(\frac{5 × 850 \, \text{匝}}{1.23 \, \text{米}}\right)(5.57 \, \text{安}) \\
&=2.42 × 10^{-2} \, \text{特}=24.2 \, \text{毫特} .
\end{aligned}
$$

需注意，式33-28同样适用于多层绕组的螺线管，因为该公式与绕组的直径无关。

### 33-5 AMPÈRE’S LAW
Coulomb’s law can be considered a fundamental law of electrostatics; we can use it to calculate the electric field associated with any distribution of electric charges. In Chapter 27, however, we showed that Gauss’ law permitted us to solve a certain class of problems, those containing a high degree of symmetry, with ease and elegance. Furthermore, we showed that Gauss’ law contained within it Coulomb's law for the electric field of a point charge. We consider Gauss’ law to be more basic than Coulomb's law, and Gauss’ law is one of the four fundamental (Maxwell) equations of electromagnetism.

The situation in magnetism is similar. Using the Biot—Savart law, we can calculate the magnetic field of any distribution of currents, just as we used Eq. 26-6 or Eqs. 26-13 and 26-14 (which are equivalent to Coulomb's law) to calculate the electric field of any distribution of charges. A more fundamental approach to magnetic fields uses a law that (like Gauss’ law for electric fields) takes advantage of the symmetry present in certain problems to simplify the calculation of $\vec{B}$. This law is considered more fundamental than the Biot—Savart law and leads to another of the four Maxwell equations.

This new result is called Ampère’s law and is written
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\mu_{0} i . \quad(33-29)
$$

You will recall that, in using Gauss’ law, we first constructed an imaginary closed surface (a Gaussian surface) that enclosed a certain amount of charge. In using Ampère’s law we construct an imaginary closed curve (called an Amperian loop), as indicated in Fig. 33-20. The left side of Eq. 33-29 tells us to divide the curve into small segments of length $d \vec{s}$. As we travel around the loop (our direction of travel determining the direction of $d \vec{s}$), we evaluate the quantity $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ and add (integrate) all such quantities around the loop.

The integral on the left of Eq. 33-29 is called a line integral. (Previously we used line integrals in Chapter 11 to calculate work and in Chapter 28 to calculate potential difference.) The circle superimposed on the integral sign reminds us that the line integral is to be evaluated around a closed path. Letting $\theta$ represent the angle between $d \vec{s}$ and $\vec{B}$, we can write the line integral as
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\oint B d s \cos \theta . (33-30)
$$

The current $i$ in Eq. 33-29 is the total current “enclosed” by the loop; that is, it is the total current carried by wires that pierce any surface bounded by the loop. In analogy with charges in the case of Gauss’ law, currents outside the loop are not included. Figure 33-20a shows four wires carrying current. The magnetic field $\vec{B}$ at any point is the net effect of the currents in all wires. However, in the evaluation of the right side of Eq. 33-29, we include only the currents $i_1$ and $i_2$ because the wires carrying $i_3$ and $i_4$ do not pass through the surface enclosed by the loop. The two wires that pass through the loop carry currents in opposite direction. A right-hand rule is used to assign signs to currents: with the fingers of your right hand in the direction in which the loop is traveled, currents in the direction of your thumb (such as $i_1$) are taken to be positive, whereas currents in the opposite direction (such as $i_2$) are taken to be negative. The net current $i$ in the case of Fig. 33-20a is thus $i = i_1 - i_2$.

The magnetic field $\vec{B}$ at points on the loop and within the loop certainly depends on the currents $i_3$ and $i_4$; however, the integral of $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ around the loop does not depend on currents such as $i_3$ and $i_4$ that do not penetrate the surface enclosed by the loop. This is reasonable, because $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ for the field established by $i_1$ or $i_2$ always has the same sign as we travel around the loop; however, $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ for the fields due to $i_3$ or $i_4$ change sign as we travel around the loop, and in fact the positive and negative contributions exactly cancel one another.

Changing the shape of the surface without changing the loop does not change these conclusions. In Fig. 33-20b the surface has been “stretched” upward so that now the wire carrying current $i_4$ penetrates the surface. However, note that it does so twice, once moving downward (which would correspond to a contribution $-i_4$ to the total current through the surface, according to our right-hand rule) and once moving upward (which would contribute $+i_4$ to the total). Thus the total current through the surface does not change; this is as expected, because stretching the surface does not change $\vec{B}$ at locations along the fixed loop, and therefore the line integral on the left side of Ampère’s law does not change.

Note that including the arbitrary constant of $4 \pi$ in the Biot—Savart law reduces the constant that appears in Ampère’s law to simply $\mu_0$ (A similar simplification of Gauss’ law was obtained by including the constant $4 \pi$ in Coulomb's law.)

For the situation shown in Fig. 33-20, Ampère’s law gives
$$
\oint B d s \cos \theta=\mu_{0}\left(i_{1}-i_{2}\right) . (33-31)
$$

Equation 33-31 is valid for the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ as it varies in both magnitude and direction around the path of the Amperian loop. We cannot solve that equation for $B$ unless we can find a way to remove $B$ from the integral. To do so, we use symmetries in the geometry to choose an Amperian loop for which $B$ is constant. We used a similar trick in calculating electric fields using Gauss’ law.

The following examples illustrate how Ampère’s law can be used to calculate magnetic fields in cases with a high degree of symmetry.

#### Applications of Ampère’s Law
##### A Long, Straight Wire (external points)
We can use Ampère’s law to find the magnetic field at a distance $d$ from a long, straight wire, a problem we have already solved using the Biot—Savart law.

As illustrated in Fig. 33-21, we choose as our Amperian loop a circle of radius $d$ centered on the wire with its plane perpendicular to the wire. From the symmetry of the problem, $\vec{B}$ can depend only on $d$ (and not, for instance, on the angular coordinate around the circle). By choosing a path that is everywhere the same distance from the wire, we know that $B$ is constant around the path.

We know from Oersted’s experiments that $\vec{B}$ has only a tangential component. Thus the angle $\theta$ is zero, and the line integral becomes
$$
\oint B d s \cos \theta=B \oint d s=B(2 \pi d) . (33-32)
$$

Note that the integral of $d s$ around the path is simply the length of the path, or $2 \pi d$ in the case of the circle. The right side of Ampère’s law is simply $\mu_0 i$ (taken as positive, in accordance with the right-hand rule). Ampère’s law gives
$$
B(2 \pi d)=\mu_{0} i
$$
Or
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi d}
$$

This is identical with Eq. 33-13, a result we obtained (with considerably more effort) using the Biot—Savart law.

##### A Long, Straight Wire (internal points)
We can also use Ampère’s law to find the magnetic field inside a wire. We assume a cylindrical wire of radius $R$ in which a total current $i$ is distributed uniformly over its cross section. We wish to find the magnetic field at a distance $r < R$ from the center of the wire.

Figure 33-22 shows a circular Amperian loop of radius $r$ inside the wire. Symmetry suggests that $B$ is constant in magnitude everywhere on the loop and tangent to the loop, so the left side of Ampère’s law gives $B(2 \pi r)$ exactly as in Eq. 33-32. The right side of Ampère’s law involves only the current inside the radius $r$. If the current is distributed uniformly over the wire, the fraction of the current inside the radius $r$ is the same as the fraction of the area inside $r$, or $\pi r^2 / \pi R^2$. Ampère’s law then gives
$$
B(2 \pi r)=\mu_{0} i \frac{\pi r^{2}}{\pi R^{2}}, \quad(33-33)
$$
where again the right side includes only the fraction of the current that passes through the surface enclosed by the path of integration (the Amperian loop).

Solving for $B$, we obtain
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i r}{2 \pi R^{2}} . (33-34)
$$

At the surface of the wire ($r = R$) Eq. 33-34 reduces to Eq. 33-13 (with $d = R$). That is, both expressions give the same result for the field at the surface of the wire. Figure 33-23 shows how the field depends on $r$ at points both inside and outside the wire.

Equation 33-34 is valid only for the case in which the current is distributed uniformly over the wire. If the current density depends on $r$, a different result is obtained (see Problem 13). However, Eq. 33-13 for the field outside the wire remains valid whether the current density is constant or a function of $r$.

##### A Solenoid
We consider an ideal solenoid as shown in Fig. 33-24 and choose an Amperian loop in the shape of the rectangle $abcda$. In this analysis we assume that the magnetic field is parallel to the axis of this ideal solenoid and constant in magnitude along line $ab$. As we shall prove, the field is also uniform in the interior (independent of the distance of $ab$ from the central axis), as suggested by the equal spacing of the field lines in Fig. 33-24.

The left side of Ampère’s law can be written as the sum of four integrals, one for each path segment:
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\int_{a}^{b} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{b}^{c} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{c}^{d} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{d}^{a} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s} .
$$

The first integral on the right is $B h$, where $B$ is the magnitude of $\vec{B}$ inside the solenoid and $h$ is the arbitrary length of the path from $a$ to $b$. Note that path $ab$, though parallel to the solenoid axis, need not coincide with it. The second and fourth integrals in Eq. 33-35 are zero because for every element of these paths $\vec{B}$ is either at right angles to the path (for points inside the solenoid) or is zero (for points outside). In either case, $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ is zero, and the integrals vanish. The third integral, which includes the part of the rectangle that lies outside the solenoid, is zero because we have taken $\vec{B}$ as zero for all external points for an ideal solenoid.

For the entire rectangular path, $\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ has the value $B h$. The net current that passes through the rectangular Amperian loop is not the same as the current in the solenoid because the windings pass through the loop more than once. Let $n$ be the number of turns per unit length; then $nh$ is the number of turns inside the loop, and the total current passing through the rectangular Amperian loop of Fig. 33-24 is $nhi$. Ampère’s law then becomes
$$
B h=\mu_{0} n h i
$$
or
$$
B=\mu_{0} n i .
$$

This result agrees with Eq. 33-28, which referred only to points on the central axis of the solenoid. Because line $ab$ in Fig. 33-24 can be located at any distance from the axis, we can now conclude that the magnetic field inside an ideal solenoid is uniform over its cross section.

##### A Toroid
Figure 33-25 shows a toroid, which we may consider to be a solenoid bent into the shape of a doughnut. We can use Ampère’s law to find the magnetic field at interior points.

From symmetry, the lines of $\vec{B}$ form concentric circles inside the toroid, as shown in the figure. Let us choose a concentric circle of radius $r$ as an Amperian loop and traverse it in the clockwise direction. Ampère’s law yields
$$
B(2 \pi r)=\mu_{0} i N,
$$
where $i$ is the current in the toroid windings and $N$ is the total number of turns. This gives
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i N}{2 \pi r} . (33-36)
$$

In contrast to the solenoid, $B$ is not constant over the cross section of a toroid. You should be able to show, from Ampère’s law, that $B = 0$ for points outside an ideal toroid and in the central cavity.

Close inspection of Eq. 33-36 justifies our earlier statement that a toroid is “a solenoid bent into the shape of a doughnut.” The denominator in Eq. 33-36, $2 \pi r$, is the central circumference of the toroid, and $N/2 \pi r$ is just $n$, the number of turns per unit length. With this substitution, Eq. 33-36 reduces to $B = \mu_0 n i$, the equation for the magnetic field in the central region of a solenoid.

The direction of the magnetic field within a toroid (or a solenoid) follows from the right-hand rule: curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current; your extended right thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic field.

Toroids form the central feature of the tokamak, a device showing promise as the basis for a fusion power reactor. We discuss its mode of operation in Chapter 51.

##### The Field Outside a Solenoid (Optional)
We have so far neglected the field outside the solenoid, but even for an ideal solenoid, the field at points outside the winding is not zero. Figure 33-26 shows an Amperian path in the shape of a circle of radius $r$. Because the solenoid windings are helical, one turn of the winding pierces the surface enclosed by the circle. The product $\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$ for this path depends on the tangential component of the field $B_t$ and thus Ampère’s law gives $B_t(2 \pi r) = \mu_0 i$ or $B_t = \mu_0 i / (2 \pi r)$, which is the same field (in magnitude and direction) that would be set up by a straight wire. Note that the windings, in addition to carrying current around the surface of the solenoid, also carry current from left to right in Fig. 33-26, and in this respect the solenoid behaves like a straight wire at points outside the windings.

The tangential field is much smaller than the interior field (Eq. 33-28), as we can see by taking the ratio
$$
\frac{B_{t}}{B}=\frac{\mu_{0} i / 2 \pi r}{\mu_{0} n i}=\frac{1}{2 \pi r n} . (33-38)
$$

Suppose the solenoid consists of one layer of turns in which the wires are touching one another, as in Fig. 33-24. Every interval along the solenoid of length equal to the diameter $D$ of the wire contains one turn, and thus the number of turns per unit length $n$ must be $1/D$. The ratio thus becomes
$$
\frac{B_{t}}{B}=\frac{D}{2 \pi r} . (33-39)
$$

For a typical wire, $D = 0.1 \, \text{mm}$. The distance $r$ to exterior points must be at least as large as the radius of the solenoid, which might be a few centimeters. Thus $B_t / B \leq 0.001$, and the tangential exterior field is indeed negligible compared with the interior field along the axis. We are therefore safe in neglecting the exterior field.

By drawing an Amperian circle similar to that of Fig. 33-26 but with radius smaller than that of the solenoid, you should be able to show that the tangential component of the interior field is zero.


### 33-5 安培定律
库仑定律可视为静电学的基本定律，利用它能计算任意电荷分布所产生的电场。然而在第27章中我们已说明，高斯定律可轻松且巧妙地解决一类具有高度对称性的问题。此外，我们还证明了高斯定律本身已包含点电荷电场的库仑定律形式。因此，高斯定律比库仑定律更基础，且是电磁学中四大基本（麦克斯韦）方程组之一。

磁学中的情况与此类似。利用毕奥-萨伐尔定律，我们能计算任意电流分布产生的磁场，这与利用式26-6或式26-13、26-14（均等效于库仑定律）计算任意电荷分布的电场类似。研究磁场的一种更基础方法是利用安培定律——该定律与电场中的高斯定律类似，可利用特定问题中的对称性简化$\vec{B}$的计算。安培定律比毕奥-萨伐尔定律更基础，是麦克斯韦方程组的另一组成部分。

安培定律的表达式为：
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\mu_{0} i . \quad(33-29)
$$

回顾高斯定律的应用：我们首先构造一个假想的闭合曲面（高斯面），使其包围一定量的电荷。而应用安培定律时，需构造一个假想的闭合曲线（称为安培环路），如图33-20所示。式33-29左侧表示将该闭合曲线分割为无数小段$d \vec{s}$，沿环路绕行（绕行方向决定$d \vec{s}$的方向）时，计算每一小段的$\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$并对整个环路积分（求和）。

式33-29左侧的积分称为线积分（第11章中曾用线积分计算功，第28章中用线积分计算电势差）。积分符号上的圆圈表示该线积分为闭合路径积分。设$\theta$为$d \vec{s}$与$\vec{B}$的夹角，则线积分可表示为：
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\oint B d s \cos \theta . (33-30)
$$

式33-29中的电流$i$是环路“包围”的总电流，即穿过任意以该环路为边界的曲面的总电流。与高斯定律中不考虑闭合曲面外的电荷类似，安培定律中也不包含环路外的电流。图33-20a显示了四根载流导线，任意点的磁场$\vec{B}$是所有导线电流的共同作用结果。但在计算式33-29右侧时，仅需考虑电流$i_1$和$i_2$，因为载有$i_3$和$i_4$的导线并未穿过环路所围的曲面。穿过环路的两根导线电流方向相反，需用右手定则为电流赋值符号：右手四指沿环路绕行方向，拇指指向的电流（如$i_1$）取正值，反方向的电流（如$i_2$）取负值。因此，图33-20a中环路包围的净电流为$i = i_1 - i_2$。

环路及环路内部各点的磁场$\vec{B}$确实受$i_3$和$i_4$影响，但$\vec{B}$沿环路的线积分与$i_3$、$i_4$这类未穿过环路所围曲面的电流无关。这是因为$i_1$或$i_2$产生的磁场沿环路的$\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$符号始终不变，而$i_3$或$i_4$产生的磁场沿环路的$\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$符号会随绕行方向变化，正负贡献最终完全抵消。

在不改变环路的前提下改变曲面形状，上述结论依然成立。图33-20b中曲面被“拉伸”向上，使得载有$i_4$的导线穿过该曲面，但注意导线会穿过曲面两次：一次向下（根据右手定则，对总电流的贡献为$-i_4$），一次向上（贡献为$+i_4$）。因此，穿过曲面的总电流不变——这符合预期，因为拉伸曲面不会改变固定环路上各点的$\vec{B}$，安培定律左侧的线积分也不会变化。

需注意，在毕奥-萨伐尔定律中引入$4\pi$这一任意常数后，安培定律中的常数简化为$\mu_0$（类似地，在库仑定律中引入$4\pi$也简化了高斯定律的形式）。

对于图33-20所示情况，安培定律可写为：
$$
\oint B d s \cos \theta=\mu_{0}\left(i_{1}-i_{2}\right) . (33-31)
$$

式33-31适用于安培环路周围磁场$\vec{B}$的大小和方向均变化的情况，但只有将$B$从积分中分离出来，才能求解$B$。为此，需利用几何对称性选择使$B$保持恒定的安培环路——这与利用高斯定律计算电场时的思路一致。

以下实例将说明如何利用安培定律计算具有高度对称性的磁场。

#### 安培定律的应用
##### 长直导线（外部点）
我们可利用安培定律计算距离长直导线$d$处的磁场，该问题此前已通过毕奥-萨伐尔定律求解。

如图33-21所示，选择以导线为中心、半径为$d$且平面垂直于导线的圆作为安培环路。由对称性可知，$\vec{B}$仅与$d$有关（与圆周角无关）。由于环路各点到导线的距离相等，$B$的大小在环路上处处恒定。

根据奥斯特实验可知，$\vec{B}$仅存在切向分量，因此$\theta = 0$，线积分可简化为：
$$
\oint B d s \cos \theta=B \oint d s=B(2 \pi d) . (33-32)
$$

其中，$\oint d s$为环路的周长，对圆环路而言即$2\pi d$。根据右手定则，安培定律右侧取正值$\mu_0 i$，因此：
$$
B(2 \pi d)=\mu_{0} i
$$
即
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi d}
$$

该结果与式33-13（通过毕奥-萨伐尔定律推导，过程更复杂）完全一致。

##### 长直导线（内部点）
安培定律还可用于计算导线内部的磁场。假设圆柱形导线半径为$R$，总电流$i$均匀分布在横截面上，需计算距离导线中心$r < R$处的磁场。

图33-22显示了导线内部半径为$r$的圆形安培环路。由对称性可知，$B$的大小在环路上处处恒定且沿环路切线方向，因此安培定律左侧与式33-32相同，为$B(2\pi r)$。安培定律右侧仅包含半径$r$以内的电流：由于电流均匀分布，$r$以内的电流占总电流的比例等于$r$以内面积占导线横截面积的比例，即$\pi r^2 / \pi R^2$。因此安培定律可写为：
$$
B(2 \pi r)=\mu_{0} i \frac{\pi r^{2}}{\pi R^{2}}, \quad(33-33)
$$
其中右侧仅包含穿过安培环路所围曲面的电流部分。

求解$B$可得：
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i r}{2 \pi R^{2}} . (33-34)
$$

当$r = R$（导线表面）时，式33-34简化为式33-13（此时$d = R$），即两种表达式在导线表面的磁场结果一致。图33-23展示了导线内部和外部磁场随$r$的变化规律。

式33-34仅适用于电流均匀分布的情况：若电流密度随$r$变化，结果会不同（见习题13）。但无论电流密度是否恒定，描述导线外部磁场的式33-13均成立。

##### 螺线管
考虑图33-24所示的理想螺线管，选择矩形$abcda$作为安培环路。分析中假设理想螺线管的磁场平行于轴线，且沿线段$ab$的大小恒定。如下文将证明的，磁场在螺线管内部是均匀的（与$ab$到中心轴线的距离无关），这与图33-24中磁场线等间距分布的特点一致。

安培定律左侧可表示为四段路径积分的和：
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}=\int_{a}^{b} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{b}^{c} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{c}^{d} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}+\int_{d}^{a} \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s} .
$$

右侧第一项积分结果为$Bh$，其中$B$是螺线管内部磁场的大小，$h$是路径$ab$的任意长度（需注意，$ab$虽平行于螺线管轴线，但无需与轴线重合）。式33-35中的第二项和第四项积分结果为零：对于这两段路径上的任意小段，要么$\vec{B}$与路径垂直（螺线管内部），要么$\vec{B} = 0$（螺线管外部），两种情况下$\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$均为零。第三项积分（矩形位于螺线管外部的部分）也为零，因为理想螺线管外部所有点的$\vec{B}$均视为零。

因此，整个矩形环路的线积分结果为$Bh$。由于螺线管绕组会多次穿过环路所围曲面，穿过矩形安培环路的净电流不等于螺线管中的电流。设单位长度匝数为$n$，则环路内的匝数为$nh$，穿过图33-24中矩形安培环路的总电流为$nhi$。根据安培定律：
$$
B h=\mu_{0} n h i
$$
即
$$
B=\mu_{0} n i .
$$

该结果与式33-28（仅适用于螺线管中心轴线上的点）一致。由于图33-24中的线段$ab$可位于轴线上任意距离处，因此可得出结论：理想螺线管内部的磁场在横截面上是均匀的。

##### 环形螺线管（螺绕环）
图33-25所示的环形螺线管（可视为弯成甜甜圈形状的螺线管），其内部磁场可通过安培定律求解。

由对称性可知，环形螺线管内部的磁场线为同心圆（如图所示）。选择半径为$r$的同心圆作为安培环路，并沿顺时针方向绕行。根据安培定律：
$$
B(2 \pi r)=\mu_{0} i N,
$$
其中$i$是环形螺线管绕组中的电流，$N$是总匝数。由此可得：
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0} i N}{2 \pi r} . (33-36)
$$

与普通螺线管不同，环形螺线管的磁场在横截面上并非恒定。利用安培定律可证明，理想环形螺线管外部及中心空腔内的$B = 0$。

对式33-36的深入分析可验证此前的表述——“环形螺线管是弯成甜甜圈形状的螺线管”：式中分母$2\pi r$是环形螺线管的中心周长，$N/(2\pi r)$即为单位长度匝数$n$。代入后式33-36简化为$B = \mu_0 n i$，与普通螺线管中心区域的磁场公式一致。

环形螺线管（或普通螺线管）内部磁场的方向可由右手定则判断：右手四指沿电流方向弯曲，伸直的拇指指向即为磁场方向。

环形螺线管是托卡马克装置的核心部件，该装置有望成为核聚变动力反应堆的基础，其工作原理将在第51章中讨论。

##### 螺线管外部的磁场（选学）
此前我们忽略了螺线管外部的磁场，但即使是理想螺线管，绕组外部点的磁场也不为零。图33-26显示了一个半径为$r$的圆形安培环路。由于螺线管绕组呈螺旋状，一圈绕组会穿过该环路所围的曲面。该路径的$\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s}$取决于磁场的切向分量$B_t$，根据安培定律可得$B_t(2\pi r) = \mu_0 i$，即$B_t = \mu_0 i/(2\pi r)$——这与长直导线产生的磁场大小和方向均相同。需注意，绕组除了沿螺线管表面环绕载流外，在图33-26中还存在从左到右的电流分量，因此从这一角度看，螺线管在外部点的行为与长直导线类似。

切向磁场远小于内部磁场（式33-28），两者的比值为：
$$
\frac{B_{t}}{B}=\frac{\mu_{0} i / 2 \pi r}{\mu_{0} n i}=\frac{1}{2 \pi r n} . (33-38)
$$

假设螺线管为单层密绕（如图33-24所示），则导线直径$D$对应的螺线管长度内包含一匝绕组，单位长度匝数$n = 1/D$。此时比值可表示为：
$$
\frac{B_{t}}{B}=\frac{D}{2 \pi r} . (33-39)
$$

对于典型导线，$D = 0.1 \, \text{mm}$；外部点到轴线的距离$r$至少与螺线管半径相当（约几厘米），因此$B_t/B \leq 0.001$，即切向外部磁场远小于轴线上的内部磁场，可安全忽略。

若绘制一个半径小于螺线管半径、与图33-26类似的圆形安培环路，可证明螺线管内部磁场的切向分量为零。

### 33-6 ELECTROMAGNETISM AND FRAMES OF REFERENCE (Optional)
Figure 33-27a shows a particle carrying a positive charge $ q $ at rest near a long, straight wire that carries a current $ i $. We view the system from a frame of reference $ S $ in which the wire is at rest. Inside the wire are negative electrons moving with the drift velocity $ \vec{v}_d $ and positive ion cores at rest. In any given length of wire, the number of electrons equals the number of ion cores, and the net charge is zero. The electrons can instantaneously be considered as a line of negative charge, which sets up an electric field at the location of $ q $ according to Eq. 26-17:
$$ E = \frac{\lambda_{-}}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}, $$
where $ \lambda_{-} $ is the linear charge density of electrons (a negative number). The positive ion cores also set up an electric field given by a similar expression, depending on the linear charge density of positive ions. Because the charge densities are of equal magnitude and opposite sign, $ \lambda_{+} + \lambda_{-} = 0 $ and the net electric field that acts on the particle is zero.

There is a nonzero magnetic field at the location of the particle, but because the particle is at rest, there is no magnetic force. Therefore no net force of electromagnetic origin acts on the particle in this frame of reference.

Now let us consider the situation from the perspective of a frame of reference $ S' $ moving parallel to the wire with velocity $ \vec{v}_d $ (the drift velocity of the electrons). Figure 33-27b shows the situation in this frame of reference, in which the electrons are at rest and the ion cores move to the right with velocity $ \vec{v}_d $. Clearly, in this case the particle, being in motion, experiences a magnetic force $ \vec{F}_B $ as shown in the figure.

Observers in different inertial frames must agree that if there is no acceleration of the charge $ q $ in the $ S $ frame, there must also be no acceleration in the $ S' $ frame. The particle must therefore experience no net force in $ S' $, and so there must be another force in addition to $ \vec{F}_B $ that acts on the particle to give a net force of zero.

This additional force that acts in the $ S' $ frame must be of electric origin. Consider in Fig. 33-27a a length $ L $ of the wire. We can imagine that length of the wire to consist of two measuring rods, a positively charged rod (the ions) at rest and a negatively charged rod (the electrons) in motion. The two rods have the same length (in $ S $) and contain the same number of charges. When we transform those rods into $ S' $, we find that the rod of negative charge has a greater length in $ S' $. In $ S $, this moving rod has its contracted length, according to the relativistic effect of length contraction we considered in Section 20-3. In $ S' $, it is at rest and has its proper length, which is longer than the contracted length in $ S $. The negative linear charge density $ \lambda_{-}' $ in $ S' $ is smaller in magnitude than that in $ S $ (that is, $ |\lambda_{-}'| < |\lambda_{-}| $), because the same amount of charge is spread over a greater length in $ S' $.

For the positive charges, the situation is opposite. In $ S $, the positive charges are at rest, and the rod of positive charge has its proper length. In $ S' $, it is in motion and has a shorter, contracted length. The linear density $ \lambda_{+}' $ of positive charge in $ S' $ is greater than that in $ S $ ( $ \lambda_{+}' > \lambda_{+} $ ), because the same amount of charge is spread over a shorter length. We therefore have the following relationships for the charge densities:
$$ \text{in } S: \lambda_{+} = |\lambda_{-}|, $$
$$ \text{in } S': \lambda_{+}' > |\lambda_{-}'|. $$

The charge $ q $ experiences the electric fields due to a line of positive charge and a line of negative charge. In $ S' $, these fields do not cancel, because the linear charge densities are different. The electric field at $ q $ in $ S' $ is therefore that due to a net linear density of positive charge, and $ q $ is repelled from the wire. The electric force $ \vec{F}_E $ on $ q $ opposes the magnetic force $ \vec{F}_B $ as shown in Fig. 33-27b. A detailed calculation* shows that the resulting electric force is exactly equal to the magnetic force, and the net force in $ S' $ is zero. Thus the particle experiences no acceleration in either reference frame. We can extend this result to situations other than the special case we considered here, in which $ S' $ moves at velocity $ \vec{v}_d $ with respect to $ S $. In other frames of reference, the electric force and the magnetic force have values different from their values in $ S' $; however, in every frame they are equal and opposite to one another and the net force on the particle is zero in every frame of reference.

This is a remarkable result. According to special relativity, electric and magnetic fields do not have separate existences. A field that is purely electric or purely magnetic in one frame of reference has both electric and magnetic components in another frame. Using relativistic transformation equations, we can easily pass back and forth from one frame to another, and we can often solve difficult problems by choosing a frame of reference in which the fields have a simpler character and then transforming the result back to the original frame. Special relativity can be of great practical value in solving such problems, because the techniques of special relativity may turn out to be simpler than the classical techniques.

In mathematical language, we say that the laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations) are invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Recall our discussion in Section 11-6 about invariant physical laws: we write down the law in one frame of reference, transform to another frame, and obtain a law of exactly the same mathematical form. For example, Gauss’ law, one of the four Maxwell equations, has exactly the same form in every frame of reference.

Einstein’s words are direct and to the point: “The force acting on a body in motion in a magnetic field is nothing else but an electric field.” (In fact, Einstein’s original 1905 paper, in which he first presented the ideas of special relativity, was titled “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.”) In this context, we can regard magnetism as a relativistic effect, depending on the velocity of the charge relative to the observer. However, unlike other relativistic effects, it has substantial observable consequences at speeds far smaller than the speed of light.

### 33-6 电磁学与参考系（选学）
图33-27a显示一个带正电的粒子$ q $静止在一根通有电流$ i $的长直导线附近。我们从导线静止的参考系$ S $观察该系统。导线内部存在以漂移速度$ \vec{v}_d $运动的负电子和静止的正离子核。在导线的任意长度内，电子数与离子核数相等，净电荷为零。电子可瞬时视为一条负电荷线，根据式26-17，它在$ q $所在位置产生的电场为：
$$ E = \frac{\lambda_{-}}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}, $$
其中$ \lambda_{-} $是电子的线电荷密度（负值）。正离子核也会产生类似的电场，其表达式取决于正离子的线电荷密度。由于两种电荷密度大小相等、符号相反，即$ \lambda_{+} + \lambda_{-} = 0 $，粒子受到的净电场为零。

粒子所在位置存在非零磁场，但由于粒子静止，不会受到磁力作用。因此，在该参考系中，粒子不受电磁起源的净力。

现在从与导线平行、以电子漂移速度$ \vec{v}_d $运动的参考系$ S' $分析该情况（图33-27b）。在这个参考系中，电子静止，而离子核以速度$ \vec{v}_d $向右运动。显然，运动的粒子会受到图中所示的磁力$ \vec{F}_B $。

不同惯性系中的观察者必须认同：若粒子在$ S $系中无加速度，则在$ S' $系中也必然无加速度。因此，粒子在$ S' $系中所受净力必须为零，除$ \vec{F}_B $外，还需存在另一个力抵消它。

这个额外的力源于电场。考虑图33-27a中长度为$ L $的导线段，可将其视为两根“测量棒”：静止的带正电棒（离子）和运动的带负电棒（电子）。两根棒在$ S $系中长度相同，包含的电荷数相等。当变换到$ S' $系时，根据第20-3节讨论的相对论长度收缩效应，运动的负电荷棒在$ S $系中长度收缩，而在$ S' $系中静止时具有固有长度（比$ S $系中的收缩长度更长）。因此，$ S' $系中负线电荷密度的大小$ |\lambda_{-}'| < |\lambda_{-}| $——相同电荷分布在更长的长度上。

正电荷的情况则相反：在$ S $系中，正电荷静止，正电荷棒具有固有长度；在$ S' $系中，正电荷棒运动，长度收缩，导致正线电荷密度$ \lambda_{+}' > \lambda_{+} $——相同电荷分布在更短的长度上。因此，电荷密度满足以下关系：
$$ S \text{系中：} \lambda_{+} = |\lambda_{-}|, $$
$$ S' \text{系中：} \lambda_{+}' > |\lambda_{-}'|. $$

电荷$ q $同时受到正电荷线和负电荷线产生的电场作用。在$ S' $系中，由于线电荷密度不相等，这两个电场无法抵消，$ q $受到由净正线电荷密度产生的电场力，被导线排斥。如图33-27b所示，电场力$ \vec{F}_E $与磁力$ \vec{F}_B $方向相反。详细计算*表明，此时电场力与磁力大小恰好相等，$ S' $系中粒子所受净力为零，因此在两个参考系中粒子均无加速度。该结论可推广到$ S' $系相对于$ S $系以任意速度运动的情况：在不同参考系中，电场力和磁力的大小可能不同，但始终大小相等、方向相反，粒子在所有参考系中所受净力均为零。

这一结果意义深远。根据狭义相对论，电场和磁场并非独立存在——在一个参考系中纯粹的电场或磁场，在另一个参考系中会同时包含电场和磁场分量。利用相对论变换方程，可在不同参考系间灵活转换，通常能通过选择使场形式更简洁的参考系求解复杂问题，再将结果变换回原参考系。狭义相对论的方法有时比经典方法更简便，具有重要的实际应用价值。

用数学语言表述：电磁学定律（麦克斯韦方程组）在洛伦兹变换下具有不变性。回顾第11-6节关于物理定律不变性的讨论：在一个参考系中写出的定律，经变换后在另一参考系中具有完全相同的数学形式。例如，作为麦克斯韦方程组之一的高斯定律，在所有参考系中形式完全一致。

爱因斯坦的表述直截了当：“运动物体在磁场中受到的力，本质上就是电场力。”（事实上，爱因斯坦1905年首次提出狭义相对论的论文标题即为《论动体的电动力学》。）从这个角度看，磁现象可视为一种相对论效应，取决于电荷相对于观察者的速度。但与其他相对论效应不同，磁现象在远小于光速的速度下仍能产生显著的可观测结果。
