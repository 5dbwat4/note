# Applications of Propositional Logic: Summary

## Overview
- Logic has many important applications to mathematics, computer science, and numerous other disciplines. Statements in mathematics and the sciences and in natural language often are imprecise or ambiguous. To make such statements precise, they can be translated into the language of logic.

## Translating English Sentences
### Steps to convert an English sentence to a statement in propositional logic
1. Identify atomic propositions and represent using propositional variables.
2. Determine appropriate logical connectives.

### Example
- Sentence: "If I go to Harry’s or to the country, I will not go shopping."
  - Let \( p \): "I go to Harry’s"
  - Let \( q \): "I go to the country."
  - Let \( r \): "I will go shopping."
  - Logical expression: \( (p \lor q) \rightarrow \neg r \)

### Another Example
- Sentence: "You can access the Internet from campus only if you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman."
  - Let \( a \): "You can access the Internet from campus"
  - Let \( c \): "You are a computer science major"
  - Let \( f \): "You are a freshman"
  - Logical expression: \( a \rightarrow (c \lor \neg f) \)

## System Specifications
### Example
- Sentence: "The automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full."
  - Let \( p \): "The automated reply can be sent"
  - Let \( q \): "The file system is full"
  - Logical expression: \( q \rightarrow \neg p \)

### Consistent System Specifications
**Definition**: A list of propositions is consistent if it is possible to assign truth values to the proposition variables so that each proposition is true.

### Example
- "The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer or it is retransmitted."
- "The diagnostic message is not stored in the buffer."
- "If the diagnostic message is stored in the buffer, then it is retransmitted."
  - Let \( p \): "The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer"
  - Let \( q \): "The diagnostic message is retransmitted"
  - Logical expressions: \( p \lor q \), \( \neg p \), \( p \rightarrow q \)
  - **Solution**: When \( p \) is false and \( q \) is true, all three statements are true. So the specification is consistent.

## Boolean Searches
### Example
- To find pages that deal with universities in New Mexico or Arizona, we can search for pages matching:
  - \( ( \text{NEW} \land \text{MEXICO} \lor \text{ARIZONA} ) \land \text{UNIVERSITIES} \)

## Logic Puzzles
### Example
- An island has two kinds of inhabitants, knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). You meet A and B.
  - A says: "B is a knight."
  - B says: "The two of us are of opposite types."
  - Let \( p \): "A is a knight"
  - Let \( q \): "B is a knight"
  - Logical expressions: \( q \), \( (p \land \neg q) \lor (\neg p \land q) \)
  - **Solution**: 
    - If \( A \) is a knight (\( p \) is true), then \( q \) must be true. But \( (p \land \neg q) \lor (\neg p \land q) \) would be false, which is a contradiction.
    - Therefore, \( A \) is a knave (\( \neg p \) is true), and \( B \) is also a knave (\( \neg q \) is true).

### Another Example
- A says: "At least one of us is a knave."
- B says nothing.
  - Let \( p \): "A is a knight"
  - Let \( q \): "B is a knight"
  - Logical expression: \( \neg p \lor \neg q \)
  - Truth table:
    - \( p \) | \( q \) | \( \neg p \lor \neg q \)
    - --- | --- | ---
    - T | F | T
    - F | F | T
    - F | T | T
    - T | T | F
  - **Solution**: 
    - If \( A \) is a knight (\( p \) is true), then \( q \) must be false (B is a knave).
    - If \( A \) is a knave (\( p \) is false), then \( q \) can be either true or false.

## Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?
### Example
- A father tells his two children, a boy and a girl, to play in their backyard without getting dirty. Both children get mud on their foreheads. The father says, "At least one of you has a muddy forehead," and asks, "Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?"
  - Let \( s \): "The son has a muddy forehead"
  - Let \( d \): "The daughter has a muddy forehead"
  - Logical expression: \( s \lor d \)
  - **Solution**:
    - First question: Both children answer "No" because each sees mud on the other's forehead but cannot see their own.
    - Second question: Both children answer "Yes" because they can infer that both have muddy foreheads based on the first round of answers.
