A **proposition** is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both.

Conditional Statements（条件语句）

conditional statement p → q is the proposition “if p, then q.”

p is called the **hypothesis** (or **antecedent** or **premise**) and
q is called the **conclusion** (or **consequence**)

A conditional statement is also called an **implication**（推论）.

q →p is the **converse**（逆） of p →q
¬q → ¬ p is the **contrapositive**（逆否） of p →q
¬ p → ¬ q is the **inverse**（反命题） of p →q
